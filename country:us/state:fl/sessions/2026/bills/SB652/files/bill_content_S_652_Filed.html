   79  faith and not for any improper purposes, such as to harass or to
   80  cause unnecessary delay or for frivolous purpose or needless
   81  increase in the cost of litigation. Examples of conduct for

  110  the rental, development, and sale of mobile home parks. However,
  111  the division does not have the power or duty to enforce mobile
  112  home park rules and regulations or to enforce the provisions of
  113  ss. 723.022, 723.023, and 723.033.
