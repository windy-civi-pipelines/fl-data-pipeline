354 appropriate, and the court is not required to set forth specific
355 findings or enumerate the criteria in this subsection as any
356 basis for its decision to impose adult sanctions.
357 4.5. When a child has been transferred for criminal
358 prosecution as an adult and has been found to have committed a
359 violation of state law, the disposition of the case may include
360 the enforcement of any restitution ordered in any juvenile
361 proceeding.
362 (b) Juvenile sanctions.—For juveniles transferred to adult
363 court but who do not qualify for such transfer under s.
364 985.556(3), the court may impose juvenile sanctions under this
365 paragraph. If juvenile sentences are imposed, the court shall,
366 under this paragraph, adjudge the child to have committed a
367 delinquent act. Adjudication of delinquency may not be deemed a
368 conviction, nor shall it operate to impose any of the civil
369 disabilities ordinarily resulting from a conviction. The court
370 shall impose an adult sanction or a juvenile sanction and may
371 not sentence the child to a combination of adult and juvenile
372 punishments. An adult sanction or a juvenile sanction may
373 include enforcement of an order of restitution or probation
374 previously ordered in any juvenile proceeding. However, if the

376 that the sanction is unsuitable for the child, the department
377 shall return custody of the child to the sentencing court for
378 further proceedings, including the imposition of adult
379 sanctions. Upon adjudicating a child delinquent under subsection

389 to discharge no later than 14 days before discharge. Failure of
390 the court to timely respond to the department's notice shall be
391 considered approval for discharge.
