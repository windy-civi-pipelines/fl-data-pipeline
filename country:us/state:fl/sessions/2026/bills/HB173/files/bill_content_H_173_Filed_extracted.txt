251 health or well-being. This subparagraph does not prohibit a

273 waive the parent's right to access his or her student's
274 educational or health records or to be notified about a change
275 in his or her student's services or monitoring as provided by

226 (8) STUDENT WELFARE.—
227 (c)1. In accordance with the rights of parents enumerated
228 in ss. 1002.20 and 1014.04, adopt procedures for notifying a
229 student's parent if there is a change in the student's services
230 or monitoring related to the student's mental, emotional, or
231 physical health or well-being and the school's ability to
232 provide a safe and supportive learning environment for the
233 student. The procedures must reinforce the fundamental right of
234 parents to make decisions regarding the upbringing and control
235 of their children by requiring school district personnel to
236 encourage a student to discuss issues relating to his or her
237 well-being with his or her parent or to facilitate discussion of

241 district, as required by s. 1002.22(2).
242 2. A school district may not adopt procedures or student
243 support forms that prohibit school district personnel from
244 notifying a parent about his or her student's mental, emotional,
245 or physical health or well-being, or a change in related
246 services or monitoring, or that encourage or have the effect of
247 encouraging a student to withhold from a parent such
248 information. School district personnel may not discourage or
249 prohibit parental notification of and involvement in critical
250 decisions affecting a student's mental, emotional, or physical

251 health or well-being. This subparagraph does not prohibit a
252 school district from adopting procedures that permit school
253 personnel to withhold such information from a parent if a
254 reasonably prudent person would believe that disclosure would
255 result in abuse, abandonment, or neglect, as those terms are
256 defined in s. 39.01.
257 3. Classroom instruction by school personnel or third
258 parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur
259 in prekindergarten through grade 8, except when required by ss.
260 1003.42(2)(o)3. and 1003.46. If such instruction is provided in

262 developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with
263 state standards. This subparagraph applies to charter schools.
264 4. Student support services training developed or provided
265 by a school district to school district personnel must adhere to
266 student services guidelines, standards, and frameworks
267 established by the Department of Education.

269 district shall notify parents of each health care service
270 offered at their student's school and the option to withhold
271 consent or decline any specific service in accordance with s.
272 1014.06. Parental consent to a health care service does not
273 waive the parent's right to access his or her student's
274 educational or health records or to be notified about a change
275 in his or her student's services or monitoring as provided by

277 6. Except as provided in s. 1014.04(1)(k), before
278 administering any a student well-being, mental health, or health
279 screening questionnaire or health screening form to a student in
280 kindergarten through grade 12 3, the school district must
281 provide the questionnaire or health screening form to the
282 parent, either electronically or in paper form, and notify the
283 parent of the date or time period when the questionnaire or form
284 will be administered. The school district must give the parent
285 an opportunity to opt his or her student out of participation
286 and obtain the permission of the parent.
287 7. Each school district shall adopt procedures for a
288 parent to notify the principal, or his or her designee,
289 regarding concerns under this paragraph at his or her student's
290 school and the process for resolving those concerns within 7
291 calendar days after notification by the parent.
292 a. At a minimum, the procedures must require that within
293 30 days after notification by the parent that the concern
294 remains unresolved, the school district must either resolve the
295 concern or provide a statement of the reasons for not resolving
296 the concern.
297 b. If a concern is not resolved by the school district, a
298 parent may:

305 and render a recommended decision for resolution to the State
306 Board of Education within 30 days after receipt of the request

308 reject the recommended decision at its next regularly scheduled
309 meeting that is more than 7 calendar days and no more than 30
310 days after the date the recommended decision is transmitted. The
