A temporary injunction 478 does not prohibit an employer from taking adverse action against 479 an employee for conduct unrelated to an alleged violation of 480 this section or s. 24, Art. X of the State Constitution. 481 (d)âThe court may issue a preliminary or permanent 482 injunction if it determines such injunction is just and proper. 483 (12)(a)âIf a violation of this section or s. 24, Art. X of 484 the State Constitution is found during an investigation, and the 485 violation is not remedied through settlement or otherwise, the 486 division must issue a citation to the employer.

The division shall serve 499 the citation in a manner provided by the Florida Rules of Civil 500 Procedure. The citation must advise the employer of his or her 501 right to an administrative hearing to have the citation 502 reviewed. 503 (b)âWithin 30 days after service of a citation, an employer 504 must comply with all appropriate relief specified in the 505 citation or may obtain review of the citation by providing a 506 written request for review to the director. Upon receipt of a 507 written request for review, the director shall assign the 508 citation to an administrative law judge to conduct a hearing and 509 issue a written decision.

X of the State 348 Constitution. 349 4.âThe right to cooperate with any investigation conducted 350 under this section and to testify in any proceeding or action 351 brought under this section. 352 5.âThe right to refuse to participate in an activity that 353 violates city, state, or federal law. 354 6.âThe right to oppose any policy, practice, or act that 355 violates this section or s. 24, Art. X of the State 356 Constitution. 357 (c)âThere is a rebuttable presumption that an employer has 358 violated this section or s. 24, Art. X of the State Constitution 359 if the employer takes adverse action against an employee within 360 90 days after the employee exercises a right under paragraph 361 (b). If an employee is a seasonal worker and his or her work 362 ended before the end of the 90-day period, the rebuttable 363 presumption applies if the employer fails to rehire the seasonal 364 worker in the same position at the next opportunity.

A person who 383 receives remuneration for services provided is considered an 384 employee unless the employer proves: 385 (a)âThe person is free from control or direction by the 386 employer over the performance of such service. 387 (b)âThe service provided by the person is outside the usual 388 course of business of the employer. 389 (c)âThe person is customarily engaged in an independently 390 established trade, occupation, profession, or business. 391 (8)âIt is a violation of this section: 392 (a)âTo misclassify an employee as an independent 393 contractor; or 394 (b)âFor a person or an entity to enter into a contract or 395 an agreement with an independent contractor for labor or 396 services if the person or entity knows or should know that the 397 contract or agreement does not include funds sufficient to allow 398 the independent contractor to comply with all applicable local, 399 state, and federal laws or regulations governing the labor or 400 services to be provided. 401 (9)(a)âThe division may commence investigations, actions, 402 and proceedings necessary to enforce this section.

X 405 of the State Constitution has occurred. 406 (b)âIn order to encourage a person or an entity to report a 407 suspected violation of this section or s. 24, Art. X of the 408 State Constitution, the division: 409 1.âShall keep the name and other personal identifying 410 information about the reporter confidential to the extent 411 permitted by law. The division may disclose the reporterâs name 412 or identification with the written consent of the reporter. 413 2.âShall provide a notice form to an employer being 414 investigated, which must be posted in a conspicuous and 415 accessible location at the workplace, notifying the employees 416 that the division is conducting an investigation under this 417 section. The notice form must be in English and any other 418 language that is the primary language of a majority of the 419 employees in the workplace. If displaying the notice form is not 420 feasible, the employer must provide a copy to each employee 421 through electronic means and also in printed form. 422 3.âMay certify the eligibility of a person for a visa under 423 8 U.S.C. s. 1184(p) and 8 U.S.C. s. 1101(a)(15)(U), subject to 424 applicable federal law and regulations, and other rules issued 425 by the division. 426 (10)(a)âDuring an investigation under this section, the 427 division has the power to: 428 1.âEnter and inspect the workplace. 429 2.âInspect and make copies of papers, books, accounts, 430 records, payroll, and other documents necessary to further its 431 investigation. 432 3.âQuestion witnesses under oath and in a private location. 433 4.âIssue subpoenas to compel the attendance and testimony 434 of witnesses and the production of papers, books, accounts, 435 records, payroll, and other documents necessary to further its 436 investigation. 437 5.âTake depositions and affidavits. 438 6.âInvestigate any facts, conditions, practices, or matters 439 as the division deems appropriate to determine whether a 440 violation of this section or s. 24, Art. X of the State 441 Constitution has occurred. 442 (b)âIf an employer fails to comply with a lawfully issued 443 subpoena or if a witness refuses to testify or be questioned, 444 the division may request that the court compel compliance by 445 initiating a proceeding for contempt. The court shall take 446 judicial notice under s. 90.202(13) of the Department of 447 Commerceâs seal, âDepartment of Commerce-State of Florida,â and 448 shall enforce any subpoena issued by the director or his or her 449 representative under such seal. 450 (c)âDuring an administrative or civil proceeding under this 451 section, an employer may not introduce any documentation as 452 evidence that was not provided to the division. 453 (11)(a)âDuring the course of an investigation under this 454 section or if the division reasonably believes that an employer 455 has engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in, a 456 violation of this section or s. 24, Art. X of the State 457 Constitution, the division or the Attorney General may seek 458 injunctive relief to: 459 1.âProhibit the employer from continuing to engage or 460 engaging in the violation or doing any act in furtherance of the 461 violation. 462 2.âPrevent violations or attempted violations of this 463 section or s. 24, Art. X of the State Constitution. 464 3.âPrevent any attempt to interfere with or impede the 465 enforcement of this section. 466 4.âExercise or perform any power or duty under this 467 section. 468 (b)âWhen determining whether injunctive relief is 469 appropriate, the court shall consider any potential or direct 470 harm to an employee from a violation of this section or s. 24, 471 Art. X of the State Constitution and the potential chilling 472 effect on other employees attempting to assert their rights 473 under this section or s. 24, Art. X of the State Constitution. 474 (c)âA temporary injunction remains in effect until the 475 division issues a citation to the employer or until the 476 completion of an administrative hearing, whichever is longer, or 477 until a time certain set by the court. A temporary injunction 478 does not prohibit an employer from taking adverse action against 479 an employee for conduct unrelated to an alleged violation of 480 this section or s. 24, Art. X of the State Constitution. 481 (d)âThe court may issue a preliminary or permanent 482 injunction if it determines such injunction is just and proper. 483 (12)(a)âIf a violation of this section or s. 24, Art. X of 484 the State Constitution is found during an investigation, and the 485 violation is not remedied through settlement or otherwise, the 486 division must issue a citation to the employer. The citation 487 must be in writing and describe the nature of the violation and 488 may include appropriate relief. Appropriate relief includes, but 489 is not limited to, requiring an employer to cease and desist; to 490 take any action necessary to remedy the violation, such as 491 rehiring or reinstating an employee, reimbursing lost wages plus 492 interest, or paying liquidated damages in an amount equal to two 493 times the unpaid wages, or other fines and penalties, including 494 a fine of up to $50 for each day a violation continues to exist 495 and for each employee to whom the violation occurred, payable to 496 the state or aggrieved employee; to take training classes 497 relating to compliance with this section; or to submit to 498 compliance monitoring by the division. The division shall serve 499 the citation in a manner provided by the Florida Rules of Civil 500 Procedure. The citation must advise the employer of his or her 501 right to an administrative hearing to have the citation 502 reviewed. 503 (b)âWithin 30 days after service of a citation, an employer 504 must comply with all appropriate relief specified in the 505 citation or may obtain review of the citation by providing a 506 written request for review to the director. Upon receipt of a 507 written request for review, the director shall assign the 508 citation to an administrative law judge to conduct a hearing and 509 issue a written decision. Hearings conducted under this 510 subsection are governed by the division and the rules of 511 practice and procedure adopted by the division. 512 (c)âAn administrative hearing must commence within 90 days 513 after receipt of a timely submitted request for review. The 514 administrative law judge shall render a written decision within 515 90 days after the conclusion of the hearing. The written 516 decision must include a statement of findings, conclusions of 517 law, and a recommended order that specifies all appropriate 518 relief as authorized under paragraph (a), including the amount 519 required for an appeal bond should the employer choose to obtain 520 review of the recommended order issued under this paragraph. The 521 decision must be served on all parties in a manner provided by 522 the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure. If the recommended order 523 includes a monetary remedy, the amount is due 45 days after the 524 written decision is properly served on the employer. 525 (d)1.âAn employer may obtain review of the written decision 526 and recommended order issued under paragraph (c) by filing a 527 petition for a writ of mandamus to a court having jurisdiction 528 within 45 days after the written decision is properly served on 529 the employer. If a petition for a writ of mandamus is not filed 530 within the appropriate time, the recommended order in the 531 written decision becomes final. 532 2.âBefore an employer may obtain review of the written 533 decision or recommended order, the employer must post an appeal 534 bond, in the amount specified in the recommended order, issued 535 by a licensed surety or as a cash deposit with the court. The 536 employer must provide written notice to the division and any 537 other parties of the posting of the appeal bond. 538 3.âA court may overturn a written decision based on abuse 539 of discretion. An employer establishes an abuse of discretion if 540 the employer alleges that the findings are not supported by the 541 evidence and the court determines that the findings are not 542 supported by substantial evidence when reviewing the entire 543 record. 544 4.âIf the court issues an order in favor of the aggrieved 545 party or if the appeal is withdrawn or dismissed without entry 546 of judgment, the employer is liable for the relief specified in 547 the written decision from the administrative hearing, unless the 548 parties execute a settlement agreement, in which case the 549 employer is liable for the relief specified in the settlement 550 agreement. If the written decision from the administrative 551 hearing or the settlement agreement provides for monetary 552 relief, and the employer fails to pay the amount owed within 10 553 days after entry of an order, dismissal or withdrawal of the 554 appeal, or the execution of a settlement agreement, a portion of 555 the appeal bond equal to the amount owed, or the entire appeal 556 bond if the amount owed exceeds the amount of the bond, must be 557 paid to the aggrieved party. 558 5.âIf the employer does not request review of the citation 559 under paragraph (b), file a writ of mandamus under subparagraph 560 1., or post the appeal bond as required in subparagraph 2., and 561 the time to do so has expired, or if the petition for a writ of 562 mandamus is dismissed or withdrawn without entry of judgment, 563 the clerk of the court must certify a copy of the citation or 564 written decision and recommended order issued by the division or 565 by the administrative law judge, respectively, and enter 566 judgment for the state or aggrieved party. The judgment has the 567 same force and effect as a judgment entered in a civil action 568 and may be enforced in the same manner as any other judgment of 569 the court. The court shall give priority to petitions to enforce 570 a judgment entered under this section. 571 6.âIf an employer fails to comply with a citation or final 572 order, whether issued by the division, administrative law judge, 573 or court, and has exhausted all reviews or appeals or the time 574 to file a review or appeal has expired, the division or the 575 Attorney General may commence and prosecute a civil action to 576 recover unpaid wages, including interest, fines, or penalties; 577 equitable relief; and liquidated damages owed to an aggrieved 578 person. The prevailing party is entitled to recover applicable 579 fines or civil penalties and reasonable attorney fees and costs. 580 (13)(a)âA person aggrieved by a violation of this section 581 or s. 24, Art.
