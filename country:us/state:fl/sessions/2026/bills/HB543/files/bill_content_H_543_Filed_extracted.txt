HB 543 2026
826 (1) The Legislature finds that:
827 (a) This state's growing population and economic activity
828 place increasing demands on public roads, resulting in
829 congestion, delay, and avoidable crashes at signalized
830 intersections.
831 (b) Modern signal control systems that incorporate
832 artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) can
833 dynamically optimize timing plans in response to real-time
834 conditions, improving travel time reliability, reducing
835 secondary crashes, and lowering emissions from idling vehicles.
836 (c) Intersections are often owned or operated by local
837 governments, yet the benefits of improved operations accrue to
838 the traveling public statewide; therefore, a coordinated state-
839 local partnership is in the public interest.
840 (d) Leveraging AI/ML for signal operations complements
841 existing investments in managed lanes, transit priority,
842 connected vehicle pilots, emergency preemption, and freight
843 corridors, and can be deployed at comparatively low cost and
844 high speed.
845 (e) A voluntary, performance-based grant program with
846 local matching funds will accelerate deployment of signal
847 modernizations while protecting taxpayers through measurable
848 outcomes and transparent reporting.
849 (2) The department shall implement a Next-generation
850 Traffic Signal Modernization Grant Program. The purpose of the

851 program is to assist counties and municipalities in upgrading
852 eligible signalized intersections with AI/ML-enabled detection,
853 controllers, communications, and software that prioritizes
854 modernization in key corridors across this state.
855 (3)(a) The department shall implement a state-local
856 partnership through a cost-sharing arrangement as follows:
857 1. Authorize the department to fund first-year pilot
858 corridors at up to 80 percent of eligible costs, with a minimum
859 20 percent local contribution.
860 2. Authorize the department to fund 50 percent of ensuing
861 year research and development and installation.
862 (b) Ongoing maintenance after signal modernization shall
863 be the responsibility of the local government and the vendor.
864 (4) The department may waive any local match requirement
865 for state-owned or state-operated intersections.
866 (5) The department shall prioritize grant applications for
867 intersections at which a signal modernization will measurably:
868 (a) Reduce average control delay and corridor travel
869 times.
870 (b) Improve surrogate safety measures, such as failures to
871 stop at red lights and hard-braking events, and support
872 emergency vehicle preemption.
873 (c) Provide transit signal priority and multimodal
874 benefits to pedestrians and cyclists.

878 cybersecurity standards, such as SOC 2 and ISO 27001, ensuring
879 robust data protection. The program shall also:
880 (a) Require open, interoperable, and secure systems that
881 avoid vendor lock in and protect cybersecurity.
882 (b) Ensure data transparency through standardized
883 performance dashboards and annual public reports demonstrating
884 benefits relative to cost.
885 (c) Coordinate with metropolitan planning organizations,
886 regional traffic management centers, and law enforcement, fire
887 rescue, and transit agencies to maximize systemwide benefits.
888 (d) Encourage use of state-based pilots, sandboxes, and
889 independent evaluations to validate performance before large-
890 scale rollout.
891 (e) Support workforce development and local operations
892 staff training so upgrades remain effective over the life of the
893 equipment.
894 (7) Beginning in fiscal year 2026-2027, $20 million is
895 appropriated annually from the State Transportation Trust Fund
896 to the department to fund the Next-generation Traffic Signal
897 Modernization Grant Program as described in this section.

HB 543 2026
826 (1) The Legislature finds that:
827 (a) This state's growing population and economic activity
828 place increasing demands on public roads, resulting in
829 congestion, delay, and avoidable crashes at signalized
830 intersections.
831 (b) Modern signal control systems that incorporate
832 artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) can
833 dynamically optimize timing plans in response to real-time
834 conditions, improving travel time reliability, reducing
835 secondary crashes, and lowering emissions from idling vehicles.
836 (c) Intersections are often owned or operated by local
837 governments, yet the benefits of improved operations accrue to
838 the traveling public statewide; therefore, a coordinated state-
839 local partnership is in the public interest.
840 (d) Leveraging AI/ML for signal operations complements
841 existing investments in managed lanes, transit priority,
842 connected vehicle pilots, emergency preemption, and freight
843 corridors, and can be deployed at comparatively low cost and
844 high speed.
845 (e) A voluntary, performance-based grant program with
846 local matching funds will accelerate deployment of signal
847 modernizations while protecting taxpayers through measurable
848 outcomes and transparent reporting.
849 (2) The department shall implement a Next-generation
850 Traffic Signal Modernization Grant Program. The purpose of the

851 program is to assist counties and municipalities in upgrading
852 eligible signalized intersections with AI/ML-enabled detection,
853 controllers, communications, and software that prioritizes
854 modernization in key corridors across this state.
855 (3)(a) The department shall implement a state-local
856 partnership through a cost-sharing arrangement as follows:
857 1. Authorize the department to fund first-year pilot
858 corridors at up to 80 percent of eligible costs, with a minimum
859 20 percent local contribution.
860 2. Authorize the department to fund 50 percent of ensuing
861 year research and development and installation.
862 (b) Ongoing maintenance after signal modernization shall
863 be the responsibility of the local government and the vendor.
864 (4) The department may waive any local match requirement
865 for state-owned or state-operated intersections.
866 (5) The department shall prioritize grant applications for
867 intersections at which a signal modernization will measurably:
868 (a) Reduce average control delay and corridor travel
869 times.
870 (b) Improve surrogate safety measures, such as failures to
871 stop at red lights and hard-braking events, and support
872 emergency vehicle preemption.
873 (c) Provide transit signal priority and multimodal
874 benefits to pedestrians and cyclists.
875 (6) The department shall use competitive procurement as

877 state-of-the-art technology that complies with leading
878 cybersecurity standards, such as SOC 2 and ISO 27001, ensuring
879 robust data protection. The program shall also:
880 (a) Require open, interoperable, and secure systems that
881 avoid vendor lock in and protect cybersecurity.
882 (b) Ensure data transparency through standardized
883 performance dashboards and annual public reports demonstrating
884 benefits relative to cost.
885 (c) Coordinate with metropolitan planning organizations,
886 regional traffic management centers, and law enforcement, fire
887 rescue, and transit agencies to maximize systemwide benefits.
888 (d) Encourage use of state-based pilots, sandboxes, and
889 independent evaluations to validate performance before large-
890 scale rollout.
891 (e) Support workforce development and local operations
892 staff training so upgrades remain effective over the life of the
893 equipment.
894 (7) Beginning in fiscal year 2026-2027, $20 million is
895 appropriated annually from the State Transportation Trust Fund
896 to the department to fund the Next-generation Traffic Signal
897 Modernization Grant Program as described in this section.

1101 adopted and promulgated by it and, for this purpose, to:
1102 (11) Establish ambient air quality and water quality
1103 standards for the state as a whole or for any part thereof, and
1104 also standards for the abatement of excessive and unnecessary
1105 noise. The department is authorized to establish reasonable
1106 zones of mixing for discharges into waters. For existing
1107 installations as defined by rule 62-520.200(10), Florida
1108 Administrative Code, effective July 12, 2009, zones of discharge
1109 to groundwater are authorized horizontally to a facility's or
1110 owner's property boundary and extending vertically to the base
1111 of a specifically designated aquifer or aquifers. Such zones of
1112 discharge may be modified in accordance with procedures
1113 specified in department rules. Exceedance of primary and
1114 secondary groundwater standards that occur within a zone of
1115 discharge does not create liability pursuant to this chapter or
1116 chapter 376 for site cleanup, and the exceedance of soil cleanup
1117 target levels is not a basis for enforcement or site cleanup.
1118 (c) The department, by rule, shall establish water quality
1119 criteria for wetlands which criteria give appropriate
1120 recognition to the water quality of such wetlands in their
1121 natural state.
1122
1123 This act may not be construed to invalidate any existing
1124 department rule relating to mixing zones. The department shall
1125 cooperate with the Department of Highway Safety and Motor
