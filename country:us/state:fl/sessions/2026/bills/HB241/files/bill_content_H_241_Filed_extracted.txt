304 (b) The defense of a material noncompliance with s.
305 83.51(2) s. 83.51(1) may be raised by the tenant if 7 days have
306 elapsed after the delivery of written notice by the tenant to
307 the landlord, specifying the noncompliance and indicating the
308 intention of the tenant not to pay rent by reason thereof. Such
309 notice by the tenant may be given to the landlord, the
310 landlord's representative as designated pursuant to s. 83.50, a
311 resident manager, or the person or entity who collects the rent
312 on behalf of the landlord. A material noncompliance with s.
313 83.51(2) s. 83.51(1) by the landlord is a complete defense to an
314 action for possession based upon nonpayment of rent, and, upon
315 hearing, the court or the jury, as the case may be, shall
316 determine the amount, if any, by which the rent is to be reduced
317 to reflect the diminution in value of the dwelling unit during
318 the period of noncompliance with s. 83.51(2) s. 83.51(1). After
319 consideration of all other relevant issues, the court shall
320 enter appropriate judgment.
321 Section 6. This act shall take effect July 1, 2026.

316 determine the amount, if any, by which the rent is to be reduced
317 to reflect the diminution in value of the dwelling unit during
318 the period of noncompliance with s. 83.51(2) s. 83.51(1). After
319 consideration of all other relevant issues, the court shall
320 enter appropriate judgment.
