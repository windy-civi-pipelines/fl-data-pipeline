    7         incorporate the amendment made to s. 874.03, F.S., in
    8         references thereto; providing an effective date.
    9          
   10  Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Florida:
   11  
   12         Section 1.âSubsection (3) of section 874.03, Florida
   13  Statutes, is amended to read:
   14         874.03âDefinitions.âAs used in this chapter:
   15         (3)ââCriminal gang memberâ <u class="Insert">means</u> <s class="Remove">is</s> a person who <u class="Insert">either</u>
   16  <u class="Insert">admits in person or on social media to criminal gang membership</u>

   18         (a)â<u class="Insert">Is identified or claimed by a</u> <s class="Remove">Admits to</s> criminal gang

   48  Where a single act or factual transaction satisfies the
   49  requirements of more than one of the criteria in this
   50  subsection, each of those criteria has thereby been satisfied
   51  for the purposes of <u class="Insert">this subsection</u> <s class="Remove">the statute</s>.

   61  provided in s. 874.03.
   62         Section 3.âFor the purpose of incorporating the amendment
   63  made by this act to section 874.03, Florida Statutes, in a
   64  reference thereto, paragraph (n) of subsection (6) of section
   65  921.141, Florida Statutes, is reenacted to read:

   67  felonies; further proceedings to determine sentence.â
   68         (6)âAGGRAVATING FACTORS.âAggravating factors shall be
   69  limited to the following:
   70         (n)âThe capital felony was committed by a criminal gang
   71  member, as defined in s. 874.03.
   72         Section 4.âFor the purpose of incorporating the amendment
   73  made by this act to section 874.03, Florida Statutes, in a
   74  reference thereto, subsection (11) of section 951.23, Florida
   75  Statutes, is reenacted to read:
   76         951.23âCounty and municipal detention facilities;
   77  definitions; administration; standards and requirements.â

   79  detention facility may designate an individual to be responsible
   80  for assessing whether each current inmate is a criminal gang
   81  member or associate using the criteria in s. 874.03. The
   82  individual should at least once biweekly transmit information on
   83  inmates believed to be criminal gang members or associates to
   84  the arresting law enforcement agency.
   85         Section 5.âThis act shall take effect July 1, 2026.
