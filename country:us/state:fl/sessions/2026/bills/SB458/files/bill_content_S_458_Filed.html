    1                        A bill to be entitled                      
    2         An act relating to the tourist development tax;
    3         amending s. 125.0104, F.S.; revising the percentage of
    4         tourist development tax revenues that must be spent to
    5         promote and advertise tourism in order for any tourist
    6         development tax revenues to be used for a specified
    7         purpose; providing an effective date.
    8          
    9  Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Florida:
   10  
   11         Section 1.âParagraph (a) of subsection (5) of section
   12  125.0104, Florida Statutes, is amended to read:
   13         125.0104âTourist development tax; procedure for levying;
   14  authorized uses; referendum; enforcement.â
   15         (5)âAUTHORIZED USES OF REVENUE.â
   16         (a)âAll tax revenues received pursuant to this section by a
   17  county imposing the tourist development tax shall be used by
   18  that county for the following purposes only:
   19         1.âTo acquire, construct, extend, enlarge, remodel, repair,
   20  improve, maintain, operate, or promote one or more:
   21         a.âPublicly owned and operated convention centers, sports
   22  stadiums, sports arenas, coliseums, or auditoriums within the
   23  boundaries of the county or subcounty special taxing district in
   24  which the tax is levied;
   25         b.âAuditoriums that are publicly owned but are operated by
   26  organizations that are exempt from federal taxation pursuant to
   27  26 U.S.C. s. 501(c)(3) and open to the public, within the
   28  boundaries of the county or subcounty special taxing district in
   29  which the tax is levied; or
   30         c.âAquariums or museums that are publicly owned and
   31  operated or owned and operated by not-for-profit organizations
   32  and open to the public, within the boundaries of the county or
   33  subcounty special taxing district in which the tax is levied;
   34         2.âTo promote zoological parks that are publicly owned and
   35  operated or owned and operated by not-for-profit organizations
   36  and open to the public;
   37         3.âTo promote and advertise tourism in this state and
   38  nationally and internationally; however, if tax revenues are
   39  expended for an activity, service, venue, or event, the
   40  activity, service, venue, or event must have as one of its main
   41  purposes the attraction of tourists as evidenced by the
   42  promotion of the activity, service, venue, or event to tourists;
   43         4.âTo fund convention bureaus, tourist bureaus, tourist
   44  information centers, and news bureaus as county agencies or by
   45  contract with the chambers of commerce or similar associations
   46  in the county, which may include any indirect administrative
   47  costs for services performed by the county on behalf of the
   48  promotion agency;
   49         5.âTo finance beach park facilities, or beach, channel,
   50  estuary, or lagoon improvement, maintenance, renourishment,
   51  restoration, and erosion control, including construction of
   52  beach groins and shoreline protection, enhancement, cleanup, or
   53  restoration of inland lakes and rivers to which there is public
   54  access as those uses relate to the physical preservation of the
   55  beach, shoreline, channel, estuary, lagoon, or inland lake or
   56  river. However, any funds identified by a county as the local
   57  matching source for beach renourishment, restoration, or erosion
   58  control projects included in the long-range budget plan of the
   59  stateâs Beach Management Plan, pursuant to s. 161.091, or funds
   60  contractually obligated by a county in the financial plan for a
   61  federally authorized shore protection project may not be used or
   62  loaned for any other purpose. In counties of fewer than 100,000
   63  population, up to 10 percent of the revenues from the tourist
   64  development tax may be used for beach park facilities;
   65         6.âTo acquire, construct, extend, enlarge, remodel, repair,
   66  improve, maintain, operate, or finance public facilities within
   67  the boundaries of the county or subcounty special taxing
   68  district in which the tax is levied, if the public facilities
   69  are needed to increase tourist-related business activities in
   70  the county or subcounty special district and are recommended by
   71  the county tourist development council created pursuant to
   72  paragraph (4)(e). Tax revenues may be used for any related land
   73  acquisition, land improvement, design and engineering costs, and
   74  all other professional and related costs required to bring the
   75  public facilities into service. As used in this subparagraph,
   76  the term âpublic facilitiesâ means major capital improvements
   77  that have a life expectancy of 5 or more years, including, but
   78  not limited to, transportation, sanitary sewer, solid waste,
   79  drainage, potable water, and pedestrian facilities. Tax revenues
   80  may be used for these purposes only if the following conditions
   81  are satisfied:
   82         a.âIn the county fiscal year immediately preceding the
   83  fiscal year in which the tax revenues were initially used for
   84  such purposes, at least $10 million in tourist development tax
   85  revenue was received or the county is a fiscally constrained
   86  county, as described in s. 218.67(1), located adjacent to the
   87  Gulf of America or the Atlantic Ocean;
   88         b.âThe county governing board approves the use for the
   89  proposed public facilities by a vote of at least two-thirds of
   90  its membership;
   91         c.âNo more than 70 percent of the cost of the proposed
   92  public facilities will be paid for with tourist development tax
   93  revenues, and sources of funding for the remaining cost are
   94  identified and confirmed by the county governing board;
   95         d.âAt least <u class="Insert">20</u> <s class="Remove">40</s> percent of all tourist development tax
   96  revenues collected in the county are spent to promote and
   97  advertise tourism as provided by this subsection; and
   98         e.âAn independent professional analysis, performed at the
   99  expense of the county tourist development council, demonstrates
  100  the positive impact of the infrastructure project on tourist
  101  related businesses in the county; or
  102         7.âTo employ, train, equip, insure, or otherwise fund the
  103  provision of lifeguards certified by the American Red Cross, the
  104  Y.M.C.A., or an equivalent nationally recognized aquatic
  105  training program, for beaches on the Gulf of America or the
  106  Atlantic Ocean.
  107  
  108  Subparagraphs 1. and 2. may be implemented through service
  109  contracts and leases with lessees that have sufficient expertise
  110  or financial capability to operate such facilities.
  111         Section 2.âThis act shall take effect July 1, 2026.
