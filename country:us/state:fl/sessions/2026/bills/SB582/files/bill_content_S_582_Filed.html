    2         An act relating to required reports of the Office of
    3         Insurance Regulation; amending s. 624.315, F.S.;
    4         providing legislative findings; requiring the office
    5         to create specified reports on insurers, licensees,
    6         registrants, and their related entities, including the
    7         compensation of their executive officers; specifying
    8         requirements for such reports; requiring the office to

   10         the reports annually to specified entities; requiring

   12         methodology and software to create specified reports
   13         and review such methodology and software for accuracy;
   14         specifying that certain data are not considered trade

   16         prohibiting insurers from withholding certain data
   17         from the office on certain grounds; amending s.
   18         627.062, F.S.; revising the facts the office must

   22          
   23  Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Florida:
   24  
   25         Section 1.âPresent paragraph (c) of subsection (4) of
   26  section 624.315, Florida Statutes, is redesignated as paragraph
   27  (d), and a new paragraph (c) is added to that subsection, to
   28  read:
   29         624.315âAnnual reports; quarterly reports.â
   30         (4)
   31         <u class="Insert">(c)1.âThe Legislature finds that the state has a strong and</u>
   32  <u class="Insert">legitimate financial interest in the health and performance of</u>
   33  <u class="Insert">the property and casualty insurance market. Further, the costs</u>
   34  <u class="Insert">of property insurance may have a strong impact on the</u>
   35  <u class="Insert">performance of Floridaâs housing market, to the benefit or</u>
   36  <u class="Insert">detriment of Florida residents. Therefore, it is in the interest</u>
   37  <u class="Insert">of Floridians that the office collect and analyze data regarding</u>
   38  <u class="Insert">market conduct and performance.</u>
   39         <u class="Insert">2.</u><u class="Insert">â</u><u class="Insert">The office shall create a report that, for each insurer,</u>
   40  <u class="Insert">licensee, or registrant, provides a list of related entities,</u>
   41  <u class="Insert">including, but not limited to, subsidiaries, management</u>
   42  <u class="Insert">companies, captive vendors, and reinsurers which share common</u>
   43  <u class="Insert">executive officers, directors, or offices or at least 10 percent</u>
   44  <u class="Insert">common ownership with the insurer, licensee, or registrant. The</u>
   45  <u class="Insert">report must also detail the financial relationship between the</u>
   46  <u class="Insert">entities. The office shall publish the report on its website and</u>
   47  <u class="Insert">submit it to the commission, the President of the Senate, the</u>
   48  <u class="Insert">Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the legislative</u>
   49  <u class="Insert">committees with jurisdiction over matters of insurance on or</u>
   50  <u class="Insert">before January 31 of each year.</u>
   51         <u class="Insert">3.</u><u class="Insert">â</u><u class="Insert">The office shall create a report detailing the</u>
   52  <u class="Insert">compensation of executive officers for each insurer, licensee,</u>
   53  <u class="Insert">or registrant, including, but not limited to, salaries,</u>
   54  <u class="Insert">benefits, stock options, bonuses, stock buybacks, and other</u>
   55  <u class="Insert">taxable payments, expressed both as dollar amounts and as a</u>
   56  <u class="Insert">percentage of the entityâs total revenue. The report must</u>
   57  <u class="Insert">include the profits and losses of each entity as reported in its</u>
   58  <u class="Insert">financial statements and highlight any compensation exceeding</u>
   59  <u class="Insert">the industry average. The office shall also include in the</u>
   60  <u class="Insert">report any rationale provided by the insurer justifying</u>
   61  <u class="Insert">compensation exceeding the industry average. The office shall</u>
   62  <u class="Insert">publish the report on its website and submit it to the</u>
   63  <u class="Insert">commission, the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the</u>
   64  <u class="Insert">House of Representatives, and the legislative committees with</u>
   65  <u class="Insert">jurisdiction over matters of insurance on or before January 31</u>
   66  <u class="Insert">of each year.</u>
   67         <u class="Insert">4.</u><u class="Insert">â</u><u class="Insert">To create the reports required under subparagraphs 2.</u>
   68  <u class="Insert">and 3., the office shall use a reliable and up-to-date</u>
   69  <u class="Insert">methodology and software and shall routinely review such</u>
   70  <u class="Insert">methodology and software for accuracy.</u>
   71         <u class="Insert">5.</u><u class="Insert">â</u><u class="Insert">Any data provided by insurers to the office under this</u>
   72  <u class="Insert">paragraph </u><u class="Insert">are</u><u class="Insert"> not considered trade secret</u><u class="Insert">s</u><u class="Insert"> under s. 812.081, and</u>
   73  <u class="Insert">the office may use such data for market analysis, financial</u>
   74  <u class="Insert">assessments, rate-setting, and compliance reviews. Insurers may</u>
   75  <u class="Insert">not withhold any financial </u><u class="Insert">or</u><u class="Insert"> other data requested by the office</u>
   76  <u class="Insert">under this paragraph as being business sensitive or trade</u>
   77  <u class="Insert">secret</u><u class="Insert">s</u><u class="Insert">.</u>
   78         Section 2.âParagraph (b) of subsection (2) of section
   79  627.062, Florida Statutes, is amended to read:
   80         627.062âRate standards.â
   81         (2)âAs to all such classes of insurance:
   82         (b)âUpon receiving a rate filing, the office shall review
   83  the filing to determine <u class="Insert">whether</u> <s class="Remove">if</s> a rate is excessive,
   84  inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory. In making that
   85  determination, the office shall, in accordance with generally
   86  accepted and reasonable actuarial techniques, consider the
   87  following factors:
   88         1.âPast and prospective loss experience within and without
   89  this state.
   90         2.âPast and prospective expenses.
   91         3.âThe degree of competition among insurers for the risk
   92  insured.
   93         4.âInvestment income reasonably expected by the insurer,
   94  consistent with the insurerâs investment practices, from
   95  investable premiums anticipated in the filing, plus any other
   96  expected income from currently invested assets representing the
   97  amount expected on unearned premium reserves and loss reserves.
   98  The commission may adopt rules using reasonable techniques of
   99  actuarial science and economics to specify the manner in which
  100  insurers calculate investment income attributable to classes of
  101  insurance written in this state and the manner in which
  102  investment income is used to calculate insurance rates. Such
  103  manner must contemplate allowances for an underwriting profit
  104  factor and full consideration of investment income that produces
  105  a reasonable rate of return; however, investment income from
  106  invested surplus may not be considered.
  107         5.âThe reasonableness of the judgment reflected in the
  108  filing.
  109         6.âDividends, savings, or unabsorbed premium deposits
  110  allowed or returned to policyholders, members, or subscribers in
  111  this state.
  112         7.âThe adequacy of loss reserves.
  113         8.âThe cost of reinsurance. The office may not disapprove a
  114  rate as excessive solely due to the insurer having obtained
  115  catastrophic reinsurance to cover the insurerâs estimated 250
  116  year probable maximum loss or any lower level of loss.
  117         9.âTrend factors, including trends in actual losses per
  118  insured unit for the insurer making the filing.
  119         10.âConflagration and catastrophe hazards, if applicable.
  120         11.âProjected hurricane losses, if applicable, which must
  121  be estimated using a model or method found to be acceptable or
  122  reliable by the Florida Commission on Hurricane Loss Projection
  123  Methodology, and as further provided in s. 627.0628.
  124         12.âProjected flood losses for personal residential
  125  property insurance, if applicable, which may be estimated using
  126  a model or method, or a straight average of model results or
  127  output ranges, independently found to be acceptable or reliable
  128  by the Florida Commission on Hurricane Loss Projection
  129  Methodology and as further provided in s. 627.0628.
  130         13.âA reasonable margin for underwriting profit and
  131  contingencies.
  132         14.âThe cost of medical services, if applicable.
  133         15.â<u class="Insert">Any report created by the </u><u class="Insert">office</u><u class="Insert"> </u><u class="Insert">pursuant to</u><u class="Insert"> s.</u>
  134  <u class="Insert">624.315(4)</u><u class="Insert">(c)3</u><u class="Insert">.</u>
  135         <u class="Insert">1</u><u class="Insert">6</u><u class="Insert">.</u>âOther relevant factors that affect the frequency or
  136  severity of claims or expenses.
  137  
  138  The provisions of this subsection do not apply to workersâ
  139  compensation, employerâs liability insurance, and motor vehicle
  140  insurance.
  141         Section 3.âThis act shall take effect July 1, 2026.
