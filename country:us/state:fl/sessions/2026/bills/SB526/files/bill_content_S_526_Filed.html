  172  doors, roofing, skylights, windows, shutters, impact protective
  173  systems, <u class="Insert">mitigation,</u> and structural components as established by

  176  windstorm, or impact protection from wind-borne debris from a
  177  hurricane or windstorm unless it is approved pursuant to this
  178  section or s. 553.8425. Any person who advertises, sells,
  179  offers, provides, distributes, or markets a product as
  180  hurricane, windstorm, or impact protection from wind-borne
  181  debris without such approval is subject to the Florida Deceptive
  182  and Unfair Trade Practices Act under part II of chapter 501
  183  brought by the enforcing authority as defined in s. 501.203.
  184         (a)âProducts for which the code establishes standardized

  187  reports or listings indicating that the product or method or
  188  system of construction was in compliance with the Florida
  189  Building Code and that the product or method or system of
  190  construction is, for the purpose intended, at least equivalent
  191  to that required by the Florida Building Code:
  192         1.âA certification mark or listing of an approved

  204  A product evaluation report or a certification mark or listing
  205  of an approved certification agency which demonstrates that the
  206  product or method or system of construction complies with the
  207  Florida Building Code for the purpose intended is equivalent to
  208  a test report and test procedure referenced in the Florida
  209  Building Code. An application for state approval of a product
  210  under subparagraph 1. or subparagraph 3. must be approved by the
  211  department after the commission staff or a designee verifies
  212  that the application and related documentation are complete.

  214  after receipt of the application. Upon approval by the
  215  department, the product shall be immediately added to the list
  216  of state-approved products maintained under subsection (13).
  217  Approvals by the department shall be reviewed and ratified by
  218  the commissionâs program oversight committee except for a
  219  showing of good cause that a review by the full commission is
  220  necessary. The commission shall adopt rules providing means to
  221  cure deficiencies identified within submittals for products
  222  approved under this paragraph.
  223         (b)âProducts, methods, or systems of construction for which
  224  there are no specific standardized testing or comparative or
  225  rational analysis methods established in the code may be
  226  approved by submittal and validation of one of the following:
  227         1.âA product evaluation report based upon testing or
  228  comparative or rational analysis, or a combination thereof, from
  229  an approved product evaluation entity indicating that the
  230  product or method or system of construction was in compliance
  231  with the intent of the Florida Building Code and that the
  232  product or method or system of construction is, for the purpose
  233  intended, at least equivalent to that required by the Florida
  234  Building Code; or
  235         2.âA product evaluation report based upon testing or
  236  comparative or rational analysis, or a combination thereof,
  237  developed and signed and sealed by a professional engineer or
