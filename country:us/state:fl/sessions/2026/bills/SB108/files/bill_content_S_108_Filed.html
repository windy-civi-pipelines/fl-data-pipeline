   27          
   28  Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Florida:
   29  
   30         Section 1.âSection 627.7015, Florida Statutes, is amended
   31  to read:
   32         627.7015â<u class="Insert">Mandatory mediation</u> <s class="Remove">Alternative procedure</s> for
   33  resolution of disputed property insurance claims.â
   34         (1)âThis section sets forth a nonadversarial <s class="Remove">alternative</s>
   35  dispute resolution procedure for a mediated claim resolution
   36  conference prompted by the need for effective, fair, and timely
   37  handling of property insurance claims. There is a particular
   38  need for an informal, nonthreatening forum for helping parties
   39  <s class="Remove">who elect this </s><s class="Remove">procedure to</s> resolve their claims disputes
   40  because most homeowner and commercial residential insurance
   41  policies obligate policyholders to participate in a potentially
   42  expensive and time-consuming adversarial appraisal process
   43  before litigation. The procedure set forth in this section is
   44  designed to bring the parties together for a mediated claims
   45  settlement conference without any of the trappings or drawbacks
   46  of an adversarial process. Before <u class="Insert">participating in</u> <s class="Remove">resorting to</s>
   47  these procedures, policyholders and insurers are encouraged to
   48  resolve claims as quickly and fairly as possible. This section
   49  <u class="Insert">applies</u> <s class="Remove">is available with respect</s> to claims under personal lines
   50  and commercial residential policies before commencing the
   51  appraisal process <u class="Insert">and is a condition precedent to</u><s class="Remove">, or before</s>
   52  commencing litigation. <s class="Remove">Mediation may be requested only by the</s>
   53  <s class="Remove">policyholder, as a first-party claimant, a third-party, as an</s>
   54  <s class="Remove">assignee of the policy benefits, or the insurer.</s><s class="Remove"> However,</s> An
   55  insurer is not required to participate in any mediation
   56  requested by a third-party assignee of the policy benefits. <s class="Remove">If</s>
   57  <s class="Remove">requested by the policyholder,</s> Participation by legal counsel is
   58  permitted. Mediation under this section is also <u class="Insert">required of</u>
   59  <s class="Remove">available to</s> litigants referred to the department by a county
   60  court or circuit court. This section does not apply to
   61  commercial coverages, to private passenger motor vehicle
   62  insurance coverages, or to disputes relating to liability
   63  coverages in policies of property insurance.
   64         (2)âAt the time of issuance and renewal of a policy or at
   65  the time a first-party claim within the scope of this section is
   66  filed by the policyholder, the insurer shall notify the
   67  policyholder of <s class="Remove">its right to participate in</s> the <u class="Insert">mandatory</u>
   68  mediation program under this section. <s class="Remove">A claim becomes eligible</s>
   69  <s class="Remove">for mediation after the insurer complies with s. 627.70131(7) or</s>
   70  <s class="Remove">elects to reinspect pursuant to s. 627.70152(4)(a)3. If the</s>
   71  <s class="Remove">insurer has not complied with s. 627.70131(7) or elected to</s>
   72  <s class="Remove">reinspect pursuant to s. 627.70152(4)(a)3. within 90 days after</s>
   73  <s class="Remove">notice of the loss, the insurer may not require mediation under</s>
   74  <s class="Remove">this section. This subsection does not impair the right of an</s>
   75  <s class="Remove">insurance company to request mediation after a determination of</s>
   76  <s class="Remove">coverage pursuant to this section or require appraisal or</s>
   77  <s class="Remove">another method of alternative dispute resolution pursuant to s.</s>
   78  <s class="Remove">627.70152(4)(b).</s> The department shall prepare a consumer
   79  information pamphlet for distribution to persons participating
   80  in mediation.
   81         (3)â<u class="Insert">If the parties mutually agree, mediation may be</u>
   82  <u class="Insert">conducted by teleconference or other electronic means in lieu of</u>
   83  <u class="Insert">appearing in person. All named insureds, or their</u>
   84  <u class="Insert">representatives, must attend the mediation, regardless of how it</u>
   85  <u class="Insert">is conducted.</u> The costs of mediation must be reasonable, and the
   86  insurer must bear all of the cost of conducting mediation
   87  conferences, except as otherwise provided in this section. If a
   88  <u class="Insert">named insured or his or her representative</u> <s class="Remove">policyholder</s> fails to
   89  appear at the conference, <u class="Insert">thus preventing the mediation from</u>
   90  <u class="Insert">proceeding,</u> the conference must be rescheduled upon the
   91  policyholderâs payment of the costs of a rescheduled conference.
   92  If the insurer fails to appear at the conference, the insurer
   93  must pay the policyholderâs actual cash expenses incurred in
   94  attending the conference if the insurerâs failure to attend was
   95  not due to a good cause acceptable to the department. An insurer
   96  <u class="Insert">is</u> <s class="Remove">will be</s> deemed to have failed to appear if the insurerâs
   97  representative lacks authority to settle the full value of the
   98  claim. The insurer shall incur an additional fee for a
   99  rescheduled conference necessitated by the insurerâs failure to
  100  appear at a scheduled conference. The fees assessed by the
  101  department must include a charge necessary to defray the
  102  expenses of the department related to its duties under this
  103  section and must be deposited in the Insurance Regulatory Trust
  104  Fund. The department may suspend the insurerâs authority to
  105  appoint licensees if the insurer does not timely pay the
  106  required fees. <u class="Insert">If a party elects to request an expert or a</u>
  107  <u class="Insert">representative to attend the mediation, that party must bear any</u>
  108  <u class="Insert">costs for the attendance of the expert or representative.</u>
  109         (4)âThe department shall adopt by rule a property insurance
  110  mediation program to be administered by the department or its
  111  designee. The department <u class="Insert">shall</u> <s class="Remove">may</s> also adopt special rules <u class="Insert">that</u>

  133  mediation conference shall be deemed to be settlement
  134  negotiations in anticipation of litigation within the scope of
  135  s. 90.408. All parties to the mediation must negotiate in good
  136  faith and must have the authority to immediately settle the
  137  claim. Mediators are deemed to be agents of the department and
  138  shall have the immunity from suit provided in s. 44.107.
  139         <u class="Insert">(b)</u><u class="Insert">â</u><u class="Insert">Within 10 days after mediation is invoked, the</u>

  141  <u class="Insert">supporting documents that serve as the basis for the claim.</u>
  142         (6)(a)âMediation is nonbinding; however, if a written
  143  settlement is reached <u class="Insert">and the policyholder is not represented by</u>
  144  <u class="Insert">an attorney or a public adjuster</u>, the policyholder has 3
  145  business days within which the policyholder may rescind the
  146  settlement unless the policyholder has cashed or deposited any
  147  check or draft disbursed to the policyholder for the disputed
  148  matters as a result of the conference. If a settlement agreement
  149  is reached and is not rescinded, it is binding and acts as a
  150  release of all specific claims that were presented in that
  151  mediation conference.
  152         (b)âAt the conclusion of the mediation, the mediator shall
  153  provide a written report of the results of mediation, including
  154  any settlement amount, to the insurer, the policyholder, and the
  155  policyholderâs representative if the policyholder is represented
  156  at the mediation.

  162  submit to or participate in any contractual loss appraisal
  163  process of the property loss damage as a precondition to legal
  164  action for breach of contract against the insurer for its
  165  failure to pay the policyholderâs claims covered by the policy.
  166         (8)âThe department may designate an entity or person to
  167  serve as administrator to carry out any of the provisions of
  168  this section and may take this action by means of a written
  169  contract or agreement.
  170         (9)âFor purposes of this section, the term âclaimâ refers
  171  to any dispute between an insurer and a policyholder relating to
  172  a material issue of fact other than a dispute:
  173         (a)âWith respect to which the insurer has a reasonable
  174  basis to suspect fraud;

  179  basis to believe that the policyholder has intentionally made a
  180  material misrepresentation of fact which is relevant to the
  181  claim, and the entire request for payment of a loss has been
  182  denied on the basis of the material misrepresentation;
  183         (d)âWith respect to which the amount in controversy is less
  184  than $500, unless the parties agree to mediate a dispute
  185  involving a lesser amount; or
  186         (e)âWith respect to a loss that does not comply with s.
  187  627.70132.

  201  insurer shall notify the policyholder of his or her right to
