55 grade and a standard high school diploma. Such waiver must shall
56 be designated on the student's transcript. The statement of

65 standardized assessment are not allowed during the
66 administration of the assessment. However, instructional
67 accommodations are allowed in the classroom if identified in a
68 student's IEP. Students using instructional accommodations in
69 the classroom which that are not allowed on a statewide,
70 standardized assessment may have assessment results waived if
71 the IEP team determines that the assessment cannot accurately
72 measure the student's abilities.

81 permitted on a statewide, standardized assessment and
82 acknowledge in writing that he or she understands the
83 implications of such instructional accommodations.

86 the student's ability to perform, the assessment must shall be
87 administered in hard copy.
88 d.(I) By the 2027-2028 school year, the Department of
89 Education shall develop a version of each statewide,

134 characteristics of dyslexia, dyscalculia, and other learning
135 disorders; and informs instruction. Any student identified by
136 the system as having characteristics of dyslexia or dyscalculia

163 plan to develop and implement the written portions of the system
164 in such languages as required by this subparagraph in addition
165 to such portions in additional languages, as feasible. The
166 department shall establish criteria for when the use of such
167 portions of the system in a language other than English is
