476 9. Upon the death of a protected party as verified by a
477 certified copy of a death certificate or court order, any party
478 can request the county recorder to release a protected
479 decedent's removed information unless there is a related request
480 on file with the county recorder for continued removal of the

482 prohibited by statute or by court order. The written request to
483 release the removed information upon the death of a protected
484 party must attach the certified copy of a death certificate or
485 court order and must be notarized, must confirm the request for
486 release is due to the death of a protected party, and must

488 number, or clerk's file number for each document containing the
489 information to be released. A fee may not be charged for the

492 necessity that the home addresses, telephone numbers, dates of
493 birth, and places of employment of current legal assistants

495 criminal conflict and civil regional counsel; the names, home
496 addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, and places of

501 by the children of current legal assistants employed by the
502 office of the public defender and the office of criminal
503 conflict and civil regional counsel be made exempt from s.
504 119.07(1), Florida Statutes, and s. 24(a), Article I of the
505 State Constitution. While performing their duties of scheduling
506 meetings with criminal defendants, answering telephone calls,
507 responding to correspondence, and interacting in person with
508 criminal defendants, legal assistants and their families may
509 incur the ill will of defendants and their associates and
510 families. As a result, legal assistants and their families may
511 be targets for acts of revenge. If such identifying and location
512 information is released, the safety of legal assistants and
513 their families could be seriously jeopardized. For this reason,
514 the Legislature finds that it is a public necessity that such
515 identifying and location information be made exempt from public
516 records requirements. The Legislature further finds that the
517 harm that may result from the release of such identifying and
518 location information outweighs any public benefit that may be
519 derived from the disclosure of the information.
520 Section 3. Paragraph (c) of subsection (1) of section
521 744.21031, Florida Statutes, is amended to read:

480 on file with the county recorder for continued removal of the
481 decedent's information or unless such removal is otherwise
482 prohibited by statute or by court order. The written request to
483 release the removed information upon the death of a protected
484 party must attach the certified copy of a death certificate or
485 court order and must be notarized, must confirm the request for
486 release is due to the death of a protected party, and must

488 number, or clerk's file number for each document containing the

501 by the children of current legal assistants employed by the
502 office of the public defender and the office of criminal
503 conflict and civil regional counsel be made exempt from s.
504 119.07(1), Florida Statutes, and s. 24(a), Article I of the
505 State Constitution. While performing their duties of scheduling
506 meetings with criminal defendants, answering telephone calls,
507 responding to correspondence, and interacting in person with
508 criminal defendants, legal assistants and their families may
509 incur the ill will of defendants and their associates and
510 families. As a result, legal assistants and their families may
511 be targets for acts of revenge. If such identifying and location
512 information is released, the safety of legal assistants and
513 their families could be seriously jeopardized. For this reason,
514 the Legislature finds that it is a public necessity that such
515 identifying and location information be made exempt from public
516 records requirements. The Legislature further finds that the
517 harm that may result from the release of such identifying and
518 location information outweighs any public benefit that may be
519 derived from the disclosure of the information.
520 Section 3. Paragraph (c) of subsection (1) of section
