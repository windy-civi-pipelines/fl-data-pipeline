   25          
   26  Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Florida:
   27  
   28         Section 1.âSection 193.155, Florida Statutes, is amended to
   29  read:
   30         193.155âHomestead assessments.âHomestead property shall be
   31  assessed at just value as of January 1, 1994. Property receiving
   32  the homestead exemption after January 1, 1994, shall be assessed
   33  at just value as of January 1 of the year in which the property
   34  receives the exemption unless the provisions of subsection (8)
   35  <u class="Insert">or subsection (9)</u> apply.
   36         (1)âBeginning in 1995, or the year following the year the
   37  property receives homestead exemption, whichever is later, the
   38  property shall be reassessed annually on January 1. Any change
   39  resulting from such reassessment shall not exceed the lower of
   40  the following:
   41         (a)âThree percent of the assessed value of the property for
   42  the prior year; or
   43         (b)âThe percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for
   44  All Urban Consumers, U.S. City Average, all items 1967=100, or
   45  successor reports for the preceding calendar year as initially
   46  reported by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of
   47  Labor Statistics.
   48         (2)âIf the assessed value of the property as calculated
   49  under subsection (1) exceeds the just value, the assessed value
   50  of the property shall be lowered to the just value of the
   51  property.
   52         (3)(a)âExcept as provided in this subsection<u class="Insert">,</u> <s class="Remove">or</s> subsection
   53  (8)<u class="Insert">, or subsection (9)</u>, property assessed under this section
   54  shall be assessed at just value as of January 1 of the year
   55  following a change of ownership. Thereafter, the annual changes
   56  in the assessed value of the property are subject to the
   57  limitations in subsections (1) and (2). For the purpose of this
   58  section, a change of ownership means any sale, foreclosure, or
   59  transfer of legal title or beneficial title in equity to any
   60  person, except if any of the following apply:
   61         1.âSubsequent to the change or transfer, the same person is
   62  entitled to the homestead exemption as was previously entitled
   63  and:
   64         a.âThe transfer of title is to correct an error;
   65         b.âThe transfer is between legal and equitable title or
   66  equitable and equitable title and no additional person applies
   67  for a homestead exemption on the property;
   68         c.âThe change or transfer is by means of an instrument in
   69  which the owner is listed as both grantor and grantee of the
   70  real property and one or more other individuals are additionally
   71  named as grantee. However, if any individual who is additionally
   72  named as a grantee applies for a homestead exemption on the
   73  property, the application is considered a change of ownership;
   74         d.âThe change or transfer is by means of an instrument in
   75  which the owner entitled to the homestead exemption is listed as
   76  both grantor and grantee of the real property and one or more
   77  other individuals, all of whom held title as joint tenants with
   78  rights of survivorship with the owner, are named only as
   79  grantors and are removed from the title; or
   80         e.âThe person is a lessee entitled to the homestead
   81  exemption under s. 196.041(1);
   82         2.âLegal or equitable title is changed or transferred
   83  between husband and wife, including a change or transfer to a
   84  surviving spouse or a transfer due to a dissolution of marriage;
   85         3.âThe transfer occurs by operation of law to the surviving
   86  spouse or minor child or children under s. 732.401;
   87         4.âUpon the death of the owner, the transfer is between the
   88  owner and another who is a permanent resident and who is legally
   89  or naturally dependent upon the owner; or
   90         5.âThe transfer occurs with respect to a property where all
   91  of the following apply:
   92         a.âMultiple owners hold title as joint tenants with rights
   93  of survivorship;
   94         b.âOne or more owners were entitled to and received the
   95  homestead exemption on the property;
   96         c.âThe death of one or more owners occurs; and
   97         d.âSubsequent to the transfer, the surviving owner or
   98  owners previously entitled to and receiving the homestead
   99  exemption continue to be entitled to and receive the homestead
  100  exemption.
  101         (b)âFor purposes of this subsection, a leasehold interest
  102  that qualifies for the homestead exemption under s. 196.031 or
  103  s. 196.041 shall be treated as an equitable interest in the
  104  property.
  105         (4)(a)âExcept as provided in paragraph (b) and s. 193.624,
  106  changes, additions, or improvements to homestead property shall
  107  be assessed at just value as of the first January 1 after the
  108  changes, additions, or improvements are substantially completed.
  109         (b)1.âChanges, additions, or improvements that replace all
  110  or a portion of homestead property, including ancillary
  111  improvements, damaged or destroyed by misfortune or calamity
  112  shall be assessed upon substantial completion as provided in
  113  this paragraph. Such assessment must be calculated using the
  114  homestead propertyâs assessed value as of the January 1
  115  immediately before the date on which the damage or destruction
  116  was sustained, subject to the assessment limitations in
  117  subsections (1) and (2), when:
  118         a.âThe square footage of the homestead property as changed
  119  or improved does not exceed 130 percent of the square footage of
  120  the homestead property before the damage or destruction; or
  121         b.âThe total square footage of the homestead property as
  122  changed or improved does not exceed 2,000 square feet.
  123         2.âThe homestead propertyâs assessed value must be
  124  increased by the just value of that portion of the changed or
  125  improved homestead property which is in excess of 130 percent of
  126  the square footage of the homestead property before the damage
  127  or destruction or of that portion exceeding 2,000 square feet.
  128         3.âHomestead property damaged or destroyed by misfortune or
  129  calamity which, after being changed or improved, has a square
  130  footage of less than 100 percent of the homestead propertyâs
  131  total square footage before the damage or destruction shall be
  132  assessed pursuant to subsection (5).
  133         4.âChanges, additions, or improvements assessed pursuant to
  134  this paragraph must be reassessed pursuant to subsection (1) in
  135  subsequent years. This paragraph applies to changes, additions,
  136  or improvements commenced within 5 years after the January 1
  137  following the damage or destruction of the homestead.
  138         (c)âChanges, additions, or improvements that replace all or
  139  a portion of real property that was damaged or destroyed by
  140  misfortune or calamity shall be assessed upon substantial
  141  completion as if such damage or destruction had not occurred and
  142  in accordance with paragraph (b) if the owner of such property:
  143         1.âWas permanently residing on such property when the
  144  damage or destruction occurred;
  145         2.âWas not entitled to receive homestead exemption on such
  146  property as of January 1 of that year; and
  147         3.âApplies for and receives homestead exemption on such
  148  property the following year.
  149         (d)âChanges, additions, or improvements include
  150  improvements made to common areas or other improvements made to
  151  property other than to the homestead property by the owner or by
  152  an owner association, which improvements directly benefit the
  153  homestead property. Such changes, additions, or improvements
  154  shall be assessed at just value, and the just value shall be
  155  apportioned among the parcels benefiting from the improvement.
  156         (5)âWhen property is destroyed or removed and not replaced,
  157  the assessed value of the parcel shall be reduced by the
  158  assessed value attributable to the destroyed or removed
  159  property.
  160         (6)âOnly property that receives a homestead exemption is
  161  subject to this section. No portion of property that is assessed
  162  solely on the basis of character or use pursuant to s. 193.461
  163  or s. 193.501, or assessed pursuant to s. 193.505, is subject to
  164  this section. When property is assessed under s. 193.461, s.
  165  193.501, or s. 193.505 and contains a residence under the same
  166  ownership, the portion of the property consisting of the
  167  residence and curtilage must be assessed separately, pursuant to
  168  s. 193.011, for the assessment to be subject to the limitation
  169  in this section.
  170         (7)âIf a person received a homestead exemption limited to
  171  that personâs proportionate interest in real property, the
  172  provisions of this section apply only to that interest.
  173         (8)âProperty assessed under this section shall be assessed
  174  at less than just value when the person who establishes a new
  175  homestead has received a homestead exemption as of January 1 of
  176  any of the 3 immediately preceding years. For purposes of this
  177  subsection, a husband and wife who owned and both permanently
  178  resided on a previous homestead shall each be considered to have
  179  received the homestead exemption even though only the husband or
  180  the wife applied for the homestead exemption on the previous
  181  homestead. The assessed value of the newly established homestead
  182  shall be determined as provided in this subsection.
  183         (a)âIf the just value of the new homestead as of January 1
  184  is greater than or equal to the just value of the immediate
  185  prior homestead as of January 1 of the year in which the
  186  immediate prior homestead was abandoned, the assessed value of
  187  the new homestead shall be the just value of the new homestead
  188  minus an amount equal to the lesser of $500,000 or the
  189  difference between the just value and the assessed value of the
  190  immediate prior homestead as of January 1 of the year in which
  191  the prior homestead was abandoned. Thereafter, the homestead
  192  shall be assessed as provided in this section.
  193         (b)âIf the just value of the new homestead as of January 1
  194  is less than the just value of the immediate prior homestead as
  195  of January 1 of the year in which the immediate prior homestead
  196  was abandoned, the assessed value of the new homestead shall be
  197  equal to the just value of the new homestead divided by the just
  198  value of the immediate prior homestead and multiplied by the
  199  assessed value of the immediate prior homestead. However, if the
  200  difference between the just value of the new homestead and the
  201  assessed value of the new homestead calculated pursuant to this
  202  paragraph is greater than $500,000, the assessed value of the
  203  new homestead shall be increased so that the difference between
  204  the just value and the assessed value equals $500,000.
  205  Thereafter, the homestead shall be assessed as provided in this
  206  section.
  207         (c)âIf two or more persons who have each received a
  208  homestead exemption as of January 1 of any of the 3 immediately
  209  preceding years and who would otherwise be eligible to have a
  210  new homestead property assessed under this subsection establish
  211  a single new homestead, the reduction from just value is limited
  212  to the higher of the difference between the just value and the
  213  assessed value of either of the prior eligible homesteads as of
  214  January 1 of the year in which either of the eligible prior
  215  homesteads was abandoned, but may not exceed $500,000.
  216         (d)âIf two or more persons abandon jointly owned and
  217  jointly titled property that received a homestead exemption as
  218  of January 1 of any of the 3 immediately preceding years, and
  219  one or more such persons who were entitled to and received a
  220  homestead exemption on the abandoned property establish a new
  221  homestead that would otherwise be eligible for assessment under
  222  this subsection, each such person establishing a new homestead
  223  is entitled to a reduction from just value for the new homestead
  224  equal to the just value of the prior homestead minus the
  225  assessed value of the prior homestead divided by the number of
  226  owners of the prior homestead who received a homestead
  227  exemption, unless the title of the property contains specific
  228  ownership shares, in which case the share of reduction from just
  229  value shall be proportionate to the ownership share. In the case
  230  of a husband and wife abandoning jointly titled property, the
  231  husband and wife may designate the ownership share to be
  232  attributed to each spouse by following the procedure in
  233  paragraph (f). To qualify to make such a designation, the
  234  husband and wife must be married on the date that the jointly
  235  owned property is abandoned. In calculating the assessment
  236  reduction to be transferred from a prior homestead that has an
  237  assessment reduction for living quarters of parents or
  238  grandparents pursuant to s. 193.703, the value calculated
  239  pursuant to s. 193.703(6) must first be added back to the
  240  assessed value of the prior homestead. The total reduction from
  241  just value for all new homesteads established under this
  242  paragraph may not exceed $500,000. There shall be no reduction
  243  from just value of any new homestead unless the prior homestead
  244  is reassessed at just value or is reassessed under this
  245  subsection as of January 1 after the abandonment occurs.
  246         (e)âIf one or more persons who previously owned a single
  247  homestead and each received the homestead exemption qualify for
  248  a new homestead where all persons who qualify for homestead
  249  exemption in the new homestead also qualified for homestead
  250  exemption in the previous homestead without an additional person
  251  qualifying for homestead exemption in the new homestead, the
  252  reduction in just value shall be calculated pursuant to
  253  paragraph (a) or paragraph (b), without application of paragraph
  254  (c) or paragraph (d).
  255         (f)âA husband and wife abandoning jointly titled property
  256  who wish to designate the ownership share to be attributed to
  257  each person for purposes of paragraph (d) must file a form
  258  provided by the department with the property appraiser in the
  259  county where such property is located. The form must include a
  260  sworn statement by each person designating the ownership share
  261  to be attributed to each person for purposes of paragraph (d)
  262  and must be filed prior to either person filing the form
  263  required under paragraph (h) to have a parcel of property
  264  assessed under this subsection. Such a designation, once filed
  265  with the property appraiser, is irrevocable.
  266         (g)âFor purposes of receiving an assessment reduction
  267  pursuant to this subsection, a person entitled to assessment
  268  under this section may abandon his or her homestead even though
  269  it remains his or her primary residence by notifying the
  270  property appraiser of the county where the homestead is located.
  271  This notification must be in writing and delivered at the same
  272  time as or before timely filing a new application for homestead
  273  exemption on the property.
  274         (h)âIn order to have his or her homestead property assessed
  275  under this subsection, a person must file a form provided by the
  276  department as an attachment to the application for homestead
  277  exemption, including a copy of the form required to be filed
  278  under paragraph (f), if applicable. The form, which must include
  279  a sworn statement attesting to the applicantâs entitlement to
  280  assessment under this subsection, shall be considered sufficient
  281  documentation for applying for assessment under this subsection.
  282  The department shall require by rule that the required form be
  283  submitted with the application for homestead exemption under the
  284  timeframes and processes set forth in chapter 196 to the extent
  285  practicable.
  286         (i)1.âIf the previous homestead was located in a different
  287  county than the new homestead, the property appraiser in the
  288  county where the new homestead is located must transmit a copy
  289  of the completed form together with a completed application for
  290  homestead exemption to the property appraiser in the county
  291  where the previous homestead was located. If the previous
  292  homesteads of applicants for transfer were in more than one
  293  county, each applicant from a different county must submit a
  294  separate form.
  295         2.âThe property appraiser in the county where the previous
  296  homestead was located must return information to the property
  297  appraiser in the county where the new homestead is located by
  298  April 1 or within 2 weeks after receipt of the completed
  299  application from that property appraiser, whichever is later. As
  300  part of the information returned, the property appraiser in the
  301  county where the previous homestead was located must provide
  302  sufficient information concerning the previous homestead to
  303  allow the property appraiser in the county where the new
  304  homestead is located to calculate the amount of the assessment
  305  limitation difference which may be transferred and must certify
  306  whether the previous homestead was abandoned and has been or
  307  will be reassessed at just value or reassessed according to the
  308  provisions of this subsection as of the January 1 following its
  309  abandonment.
  310         3.âBased on the information provided on the form from the
  311  property appraiser in the county where the previous homestead
  312  was located, the property appraiser in the county where the new
  313  homestead is located shall calculate the amount of the
  314  assessment limitation difference which may be transferred and
  315  apply the difference to the January 1 assessment of the new
  316  homestead.
  317         4.âAll property appraisers having information-sharing
  318  agreements with the department are authorized to share
  319  confidential tax information with each other pursuant to s.
  320  195.084, including social security numbers and linked
  321  information on the forms provided pursuant to this section.
  322         5.âThe transfer of any limitation is not final until any
  323  values on the assessment roll on which the transfer is based are
  324  final. If such values are final after tax notice bills have been
  325  sent, the property appraiser shall make appropriate corrections
  326  and a corrected tax notice bill shall be sent. Any values that
  327  are under administrative or judicial review shall be noticed to
  328  the tribunal or court for accelerated hearing and resolution so
  329  that the intent of this subsection may be carried out.
  330         6.âIf the property appraiser in the county where the
  331  previous homestead was located has not provided information
  332  sufficient to identify the previous homestead and the assessment
  333  limitation difference is transferable, the taxpayer may file an
  334  action in circuit court in that county seeking to establish that
  335  the property appraiser must provide such information.
  336         7.âIf the information from the property appraiser in the
  337  county where the previous homestead was located is provided
  338  after the procedures in this section are exercised, the property
  339  appraiser in the county where the new homestead is located shall
  340  make appropriate corrections and a corrected tax notice and tax
  341  bill shall be sent.
  342         8.âThis subsection does not authorize the consideration or
  343  adjustment of the just, assessed, or taxable value of the
  344  previous homestead property.
  345         9.âThe property appraiser in the county where the new
  346  homestead is located shall promptly notify a taxpayer if the
  347  information received, or available, is insufficient to identify
  348  the previous homestead and the amount of the assessment
  349  limitation difference which is transferable. Such notification
  350  shall be sent on or before July 1 as specified in s. 196.151.
  351         10.âThe taxpayer may correspond with the property appraiser
  352  in the county where the previous homestead was located to
  353  further seek to identify the homestead and the amount of the
  354  assessment limitation difference which is transferable.
  355         11.âIf the property appraiser in the county where the
  356  previous homestead was located supplies sufficient information
  357  to the property appraiser in the county where the new homestead
  358  is located, such information shall be considered timely if
  359  provided in time for inclusion on the notice of proposed
  360  property taxes sent pursuant to ss. 194.011 and 200.065(1).
  361         12.âIf the property appraiser has not received information
  362  sufficient to identify the previous homestead and the amount of
  363  the assessment limitation difference which is transferable
  364  before mailing the notice of proposed property taxes, the
  365  taxpayer may file a petition with the value adjustment board in
  366  the county where the new homestead is located.
  367         (j)âAny person who is qualified to have his or her property
  368  assessed under this subsection and who fails to file an
  369  application by March 1 may file an application for assessment
  370  under this subsection and may, pursuant to s. 194.011(3), file a
  371  petition with the value adjustment board requesting that an
  372  assessment under this subsection be granted. Such petition may
  373  be filed at any time during the taxable year on or before the
  374  25th day following the mailing of the notice by the property
  375  appraiser as provided in s. 194.011(1). Notwithstanding s.
  376  194.013, such person must pay a nonrefundable fee of $15 upon
  377  filing the petition. Upon reviewing the petition, if the person
  378  is qualified to receive the assessment under this subsection and
  379  demonstrates particular extenuating circumstances judged by the
  380  property appraiser or the value adjustment board to warrant
  381  granting the assessment, the property appraiser or the value
  382  adjustment board may grant an assessment under this subsection.
  383         (k)âAny person who is qualified to have his or her property
  384  assessed under this subsection and who fails to timely file an
  385  application for his or her new homestead in the first year
  386  following eligibility may file in a subsequent year. The
  387  assessment reduction shall be applied to assessed value in the
  388  year the transfer is first approved, and refunds of tax may not
  389  be made for previous years.
  390         (l)âThe property appraisers of the state shall, as soon as
  391  practicable after March 1 of each year and on or before July 1
  392  of that year, carefully consider all applications for assessment
  393  under this subsection which have been filed in their respective
  394  offices on or before March 1 of that year. If, upon
  395  investigation, the property appraiser finds that the applicant
  396  is entitled to assessment under this subsection, the property
  397  appraiser shall make such entries upon the tax rolls of the
  398  county as are necessary to allow the assessment. If, after due
  399  consideration, the property appraiser finds that the applicant
  400  is not entitled to the assessment under this subsection, the
  401  property appraiser shall immediately prepare a notice of such
  402  disapproval, giving his or her reasons therefor, and a copy of
  403  the notice must be served upon the applicant by the property
  404  appraiser by personal delivery or by registered mail to the post
  405  office address given by the applicant. The applicant may appeal
  406  the decision of the property appraiser refusing to allow the
  407  assessment under this subsection to the value adjustment board,
  408  and the board shall review the application and evidence
  409  presented to the property appraiser upon which the applicant
  410  based the claim and hear the applicant in person or by agent on
  411  behalf of his or her right to such assessment. Such appeal shall
  412  be heard by an attorney special magistrate if the value
  413  adjustment board uses special magistrates. The value adjustment
  414  board shall reverse the decision of the property appraiser in
  415  the cause and grant assessment under this subsection to the
  416  applicant if, in its judgment, the applicant is entitled to the
  417  assessment or shall affirm the decision of the property
  418  appraiser. The action of the board is final in the cause unless
  419  the applicant, within 60 days following the date of refusal of
  420  the application by the board, files in the circuit court of the
  421  county in which the homestead is located a proceeding against
  422  the property appraiser for a declaratory judgment as is provided
  423  under chapter 86 or other appropriate proceeding. The failure of
  424  the taxpayer to appear before the property appraiser or value
  425  adjustment board or to file any paper other than the application
  426  as provided in this subsection does not constitute a bar to or
  427  defense in the proceedings.
  428         (m)âFor purposes of receiving an assessment reduction
  429  pursuant to this subsection, an owner of a homestead property
  430  that was significantly damaged or destroyed as a result of a
  431  named tropical storm or hurricane may elect, in the calendar
  432  year following the named tropical storm or hurricane, to have
  433  the significantly damaged or destroyed homestead deemed to have
  434  been abandoned as of the date of the named tropical storm or
  435  hurricane even though the owner received a homestead exemption
  436  on the property as of January 1 of the year immediately
  437  following the named tropical storm or hurricane. The election
  438  provided for in this paragraph is available only if the owner
  439  establishes a new homestead as of January 1 of the third year
  440  immediately following the storm or hurricane. This paragraph
  441  shall apply to homestead property damaged or destroyed on or
  442  after January 1, 2017.
  443         (9)<u class="Insert">(a)âProperty assessed under this section shall be</u>
  444  <u class="Insert">assessed at less than just value when the </u><u class="Insert">owner of the property</u>
  445  <u class="Insert">has</u><u class="Insert"> used the property as his or her permanent residence for 20</u>

  456  <u class="Insert">granted</u><u class="Insert">.</u>
  457         <u class="Insert">(10)</u>âErroneous assessments of homestead property assessed
  458  under this section may be corrected in the following manner:
  459         (a)âIf errors are made in arriving at any assessment under
  460  this section due to a material mistake of fact concerning an
  461  essential characteristic of the property, the just value and
  462  assessed value must be recalculated for every such year,
  463  including the year in which the mistake occurred.
  464         (b)âIf changes, additions, or improvements are not assessed
  465  at just value as of the first January 1 after they were
  466  substantially completed, the property appraiser shall determine
  467  the just value for such changes, additions, or improvements for
  468  the year they were substantially completed. Assessments for
  469  subsequent years shall be corrected, applying this section if
  470  applicable.
  471         (c)âIf back taxes are due pursuant to s. 193.092, the
  472  corrections made pursuant to this subsection shall be used to
  473  calculate such back taxes.
  474         <u class="Insert">(11)(a)</u><s class="Remove">(10</s><s class="Remove">)</s><s class="Remove">(a)</s>âIf the property appraiser determines that
  475  for any year or years within the prior 10 years a person who was
  476  not entitled to the homestead property assessment limitation
  477  granted under this section was granted the homestead property
  478  assessment limitation, the property appraiser making such
  479  determination shall serve upon the owner a notice of intent to
  480  record in the public records of the county a notice of tax lien
  481  against any property owned by that person in the county, and
  482  such property must be identified in the notice of tax lien. The
  483  property appraiser must include with such notice information
  484  explaining why the owner is not entitled to the limitation, the
  485  years for which unpaid taxes, penalties, and interest are due,
  486  and the manner in which unpaid taxes, penalties, and interest
  487  have been calculated. Such property that is situated in this
  488  state is subject to the unpaid taxes, plus a penalty of 50
  489  percent of the unpaid taxes for each year and 15 percent
  490  interest per annum. However, when a person entitled to exemption
  491  pursuant to s. 196.031 inadvertently receives the limitation
  492  pursuant to this section following a change of ownership, the
  493  assessment of such property must be corrected as provided in
  494  paragraph <u class="Insert">(10)(a)</u> <s class="Remove">(9)(a)</s>, and the person need not pay the unpaid
  495  taxes, penalties, or interest. Before a lien may be filed, the
  496  person or entity so notified must be given 30 days to pay the
  497  taxes and any applicable penalties and interest.
  498         (b)âIf the property appraiser improperly grants the
  499  property assessment limitation as a result of a clerical mistake
  500  or an omission, the person or entity improperly receiving the
  501  property assessment limitation may not be assessed a penalty or
  502  interest. Back taxes shall apply only as follows:
  503         1.âIf the person who received the limitation as a result of
  504  a clerical mistake or omission voluntarily discloses to the
  505  property appraiser that he or she was not entitled to the
  506  limitation before the property appraiser notifies the owner of
  507  the mistake or omission, no back taxes shall be due.
  508         2.âIf the person who received the limitation as a result of
  509  a clerical mistake or omission does not voluntarily disclose to
  510  the property appraiser that he or she was not entitled to the
  511  limitation before the property appraiser notifies the owner of
  512  the mistake or omission, back taxes shall be due for any year or
  513  years that the owner was not entitled to the limitation within
  514  the 5 years before the property appraiser notified the owner of
  515  the mistake or omission.
  516         3.âThe property appraiser shall serve upon an owner that
  517  owes back taxes under subparagraph 2. a notice of intent to
  518  record in the public records of the county a notice of tax lien
  519  against any property owned by that person in the county, and
  520  such property must be identified in the notice of tax lien. The
  521  property appraiser must include with such notice information
  522  explaining why the owner is not entitled to the limitation, the
  523  years for which unpaid taxes are due, and the manner in which
  524  unpaid taxes have been calculated. Before a lien may be filed,
  525  the person or entity so notified must be given 30 days to pay
  526  the taxes.
  527         Section 2.âSubsections (2) and (6) of section 194.011,
  528  Florida Statutes, are amended to read:
  529         194.011âAssessment notice; objections to assessments.â
  530         (2)âAny taxpayer who objects to the assessment placed on
  531  any property taxable to him or her, including the assessment of
  532  homestead property at less than just value under s. 193.155(8)
  533  <u class="Insert">or (9)</u>, may request the property appraiser to informally confer
  534  with the taxpayer. Upon receiving the request, the property
  535  appraiser, or a member of his or her staff, shall confer with
  536  the taxpayer regarding the correctness of the assessment. At
  537  this informal conference, the taxpayer shall present those facts
  538  considered by the taxpayer to be supportive of the taxpayerâs
  539  claim for a change in the assessment of the property appraiser.
  540  The property appraiser or his or her representative at this
  541  conference shall present those facts considered by the property
  542  appraiser to be supportive of the correctness of the assessment.
  543  However, nothing herein shall be construed to be a prerequisite
  544  to administrative or judicial review of property assessments.
  545         (6)âThe following provisions apply to petitions to the
  546  value adjustment board concerning the assessment of homestead
  547  property at less than just value under s. 193.155(8) <u class="Insert">or (9)</u>:
  548         (a)âIf the taxpayer does not agree with the amount of the
  549  assessment limitation difference for which the taxpayer
  550  qualifies as stated by the property appraiser in the county
  551  where the previous homestead property was located, or if the
  552  property appraiser in that county has not stated that the
  553  taxpayer qualifies to transfer any assessment limitation
  554  difference, upon the taxpayer filing a petition to the value
  555  adjustment board in the county where the new homestead property
  556  is located, the value adjustment board in that county shall,
  557  upon receiving the appeal, send a notice to the value adjustment
  558  board in the county where the previous homestead was located,
  559  which shall reconvene if it has already adjourned.
  560         (b)âSuch notice operates as a petition in, and creates an
  561  appeal to, the value adjustment board in the county where the
  562  previous homestead was located of all issues surrounding the
  563  previous assessment differential for the taxpayer involved.
  564  However, the taxpayer may not petition to have the just,
  565  assessed, or taxable value of the previous homestead changed.
  566         (c)âThe value adjustment board in the county where the
  567  previous homestead was located shall set the petition for
  568  hearing and notify the taxpayer, the property appraiser in the
  569  county where the previous homestead was located, the property
  570  appraiser in the county where the new homestead is located, and
  571  the value adjustment board in that county, and shall hear the
  572  appeal. Such appeal shall be heard by an attorney special
  573  magistrate if the value adjustment board in the county where the
  574  previous homestead was located uses special magistrates. The
  575  taxpayer may attend such hearing and present evidence, but need
  576  not do so. The value adjustment board in the county where the
  577  previous homestead was located shall issue a decision and send a
  578  copy of the decision to the value adjustment board in the county
  579  where the new homestead is located.
  580         (d)âIn hearing the appeal in the county where the new
  581  homestead is located, that value adjustment board shall consider
  582  the decision of the value adjustment board in the county where
  583  the previous homestead was located on the issues pertaining to
  584  the previous homestead and on the amount of any assessment
  585  reduction for which the taxpayer qualifies. The value adjustment
  586  board in the county where the new homestead is located may not
  587  hold its hearing until it has received the decision from the
  588  value adjustment board in the county where the previous
  589  homestead was located.
  590         (e)âIn any circuit court proceeding to review the decision
  591  of the value adjustment board in the county where the new
  592  homestead is located, the court may also review the decision of
  593  the value adjustment board in the county where the previous
  594  homestead was located.
  595         Section 3.âParagraph (b) of subsection (1) of section
  596  196.011, Florida Statutes, is amended to read:
  597         196.011âAnnual application required for exemption.â
  598         (1)
  599         (b)âThe form to apply for an exemption under s. 196.031, <u class="Insert">s.</u>

  602  list the social security number of the applicant and of the
  603  applicantâs spouse, if any. If an applicant files a timely and
  604  otherwise complete application, and omits the required social
  605  security numbers, the application is incomplete. In that event,
  606  the property appraiser shall contact the applicant, who may
  607  refile a complete application by April 1. Failure to file a
  608  complete application by that date constitutes a waiver of the
  609  exemption privilege for that year, except as provided in
  610  subsection (8) or subsection (9).
  611         Section 4.âSection 196.078, Florida Statutes, is created to
