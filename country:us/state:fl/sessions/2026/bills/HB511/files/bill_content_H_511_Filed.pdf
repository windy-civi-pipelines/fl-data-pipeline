83 (V) Disclosure may harm the reputation or jeopardize the

101 records exemption that existed before or is created after the
102 effective date of this exemption. Those portions of a recording
103 which are protected from disclosure by another public records
104 exemption continue to be exempt or confidential and exempt.
105 (h) This subsection is subject to the Open Government
106 Sunset Review Act in accordance with s. 119.15 and shall stand
107 repealed on October 2, 2031, unless reviewed and saved from
108 repeal through reenactment by the Legislature.
109 Section 2. (1) The Legislature finds that it is a public
110 necessity that the following types of body camera recordings
111 recorded by a code inspector in the course of performing his or
112 her official duties and responsibilities be made confidential
113 and exempt from s. 119.07(1), Florida Statutes, and s. 24(a),
114 Article I of the State Constitution: recordings taken within the
115 interior of a private residence; recordings taken within the
116 interior of a facility that offers health care, mental health
117 care, or social services; and recordings taken in a place that a
118 reasonable person would expect to be private.
119 (2) The Legislature recognizes that body cameras preserve
120 information that has the potential to assist both code
121 inspectors' and the public's ability to review the accuracy of
122 code inspection work.
123 (3) However, the Legislature also finds that, in certain
124 instances, audio and video recorded by body cameras is
125 significantly likely to capture highly sensitive personal

126 information. The exemption of body camera recordings from public
127 records requirements allows code inspectors to administer their
128 duties more effectively and efficiently, which would otherwise
129 be significantly impaired. The Legislature finds that the
130 concerns regarding the impact of public records requirements for
131 body camera recordings necessitate the exemption of the
132 recordings from public records requirements and outweigh any
133 public benefit that may be derived from their disclosure.
134 Section 3. By October 1, 2026, the Division of Library and
135 Information Services of the Department of State shall by rule
136 incorporate into the appropriate general records schedule a 90-
137 day retention requirement for body camera recordings recorded by
138 code inspectors.
139 Section 4. This act shall take effect on the same date
140 that HB 509 or similar legislation takes effect, if such
141 legislation is adopted in the same legislative session or an
142 extension thereof and becomes a law.
