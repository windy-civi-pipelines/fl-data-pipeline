290 board, at its next regularly scheduled meeting following release
291 of the program's graduate passage rate by the National Council
292 of State Boards of Nursing, shall remove the program's
293 probationary status. If the program, during the 2 calendar years
294 following its placement on probationary status, does not achieve
295 the required passage rate for any 1 calendar year, the board
296 must may extend the program's probationary status for 1
297 additional year, provided the program has demonstrated adequate
298 progress toward the graduate passage rate goal by meeting a
299 majority of the benchmarks established in the remediation plan.

303 (b) If an approved program fails to submit the annual
304 report required in subsection (3), the board must shall notify

329 to this subsection transfer to an approved or an accredited
330 program under the direction of the Commission for Independent
331 Education, the board must shall recalculate the passage rates of
332 the programs receiving the transferring students, excluding the
333 test scores of those students transferring more than 12 credits.
334 (e) If an approved program's graduate passage rate is
335 below 30 percent in a calendar year, the program must reimburse
336 the total cost of tuition and fees paid by each student who
337 failed to pass the National Council of State Boards of Nursing
338 Licensing Examination as a first-time test taker in that
339 calendar year. The program must outline its plan for meeting
340 this requirement in its written remediation plan under
341 subparagraph (a)2.
