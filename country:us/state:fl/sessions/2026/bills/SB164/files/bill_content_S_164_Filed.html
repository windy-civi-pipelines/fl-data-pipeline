   15          
   16  Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Florida:
   17  
   18         Section 1.âSection 768.18, Florida Statutes, is reordered
   19  and amended to read:
   20         768.18âDefinitions.âAs used in ss. 768.16-768.26:
   21         <u class="Insert">(5)</u><s class="Remove">(1)</s>ââSurvivorsâ means the decedentâs spouse, children,
   22  parents, and, when partly or wholly dependent on the decedent
   23  for support or services, any blood relatives and adoptive
   24  brothers and sisters. It includes the child born out of wedlock
   25  of a mother, but not the child born out of wedlock of the father
   26  unless the father has recognized a responsibility for the
   27  childâs support. <u class="Insert">It also includes the parents of an unborn</u>
   28  <u class="Insert">child.</u>
   29         <u class="Insert">(1)</u><s class="Remove">(2)</s>ââMinor childrenâ means children under 25 years of
   30  age, notwithstanding the age of majority.
   31         <u class="Insert">(4)</u><s class="Remove">(3)</s>ââSupportâ includes contributions in kind as well as
   32  money.
   33         <u class="Insert">(3)</u><s class="Remove">(4)</s>ââServicesâ means tasks, usually of a household
   34  nature, regularly performed by the decedent that will be a
   35  necessary expense to the survivors of the decedent. These
   36  services may vary according to the identity of the decedent and
   37  survivor and shall be determined under the particular facts of
   38  each case.
   39         <u class="Insert">(2)</u><s class="Remove">(5)</s>ââNet accumulationsâ means the part of the decedentâs
   40  expected net business or salary income, including pension
   41  benefits, that the decedent probably would have retained as
   42  savings and left as part of her or his estate if the decedent
   43  had lived her or his normal life expectancy. âNet business or
   44  salary incomeâ is the part of the decedentâs probable gross
   45  income after taxes, excluding income from investments continuing
   46  beyond death, that remains after deducting the decedentâs
   47  personal expenses and support of survivors, excluding
   48  contributions in kind.
   49         <u class="Insert">(6)</u><u class="Insert">â</u><u class="Insert">âUnborn childâ means a member of the species </u><u class="Insert"><i>Homo</i></u>

   52         Section 2.âSection 768.19, Florida Statutes, is amended to

   56  act, negligence, default, or breach of contract or warranty of
   57  any person, including those occurring on navigable waters, and
   58  the event would have entitled the person injured to maintain an
   59  action and recover damages if death had not ensued, the person
   60  or watercraft that would have been liable in damages if death
   61  had not ensued shall be liable for damages as specified in this
   62  act notwithstanding the death of the person injured, although
   63  death was caused under circumstances constituting a felony.

   74  for wrongful death, including the decedentâs estate, shall be
   75  identified in the complaint, and their relationships to the
   76  decedent shall be alleged. Damages may be awarded as follows:
   77         (4)âEach parent of a deceased minor child <u class="Insert">or an unborn</u>
   78  <u class="Insert">child</u> may also recover for mental pain and suffering from the
   79  date of injury. Each parent of an adult child may also recover
   80  for mental pain and suffering if there are no other survivors.
   81         (6)âThe decedentâs personal representative may recover for
   82  the decedentâs estate the following:

   85  excluding contributions in kind, with interest. Loss of the
   86  prospective net accumulations of an estate, which might
   87  reasonably have been expected but for the wrongful death,
   88  reduced to present money value, may also be recovered:
   89         1.âIf the decedentâs survivors include a surviving spouse
   90  or lineal descendants; or
   91         2.âIf the decedent is not a minor child <u class="Insert">or an unborn child</u>
   92  as <u class="Insert">those terms are</u> defined in <u class="Insert">s. 768.18</u> <s class="Remove">s. 768.18(2)</s>, there are
   93  no lost support and services recoverable under subsection (1),
   94  and there is a surviving parent.
   95  
   96  Evidence of remarriage of the decedentâs spouse is admissible.
   97         Section 4.âThis act shall take effect July 1, 2026.
