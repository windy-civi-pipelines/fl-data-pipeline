   16         WHEREAS, on average, at least one gun is stolen from a car
   17  every 9 minutes in the United States, and
   18         WHEREAS, the rate of gun thefts from cars has tripled in
   19  the last decade, showing both consistent increases nearly every
   20  year and a marked spike during the COVID-19 pandemic, and
   21         WHEREAS, a decade ago, roughly a quarter of gun thefts were
   22  from cars, but in 2022, over half of gun thefts were from cars,
   23  and
   24         WHEREAS, guns are most commonly stolen from cars parked at
   25  residences, demonstrating the importance of securely storing
   26  guns at all times and locations, and
   27         WHEREAS, cities in states with the weakest gun safety laws
