10 Section 1. (1) The Legislature finds and declares that
11 this state continues to experience unprecedented deaths caused
12 by synthetic opioids, stimulants, and other adulterated or

23 drug use, but, instead, prevent overdose and death by allowing
24 individuals and communities to identify the presence of
25 dangerous controlled substances and adulterants.
