  124  incurred for the taxable year which is equal to the amount of
  125  the credit allowable for the taxable year under s. 220.182. This

  205  
  206  However, any amount subtracted under this subparagraph is
  207  allowed only to the extent such amount is not deductible in

  216  <u class="Insert">as dividends paid by another member of the unitary combined</u>
  217  <u class="Insert">group must be subtracted from the taxable income to the extent</u>
