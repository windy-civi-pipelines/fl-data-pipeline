A corporation having less than 50 475 percent of its outstanding voting stock directly or indirectly 476 owned or controlled by a unitary combined group is considered a 477 member of the unitary combined group if the business activities 478 of the corporation are of such a nature that the corporation is 479 considered functionally integrated with, and therefore a member 480 of, the unitary combined group. All of the income of a 481 corporation that is a member of a unitary combined group is 482 unitary. For purposes of this section, the attribution rules of 483 26 U.S.C. s. 318 must be used to determine whether voting stock 484 is indirectly owned. 485 Section 5.âSection 220.1363, Florida Statutes, is created 486 to read: 487 220.1363âUnitary combined groups; special requirements.â 488 (1)âAs used in this section, the term âunitary combined 489 reporting methodâ means a method used to determine the taxable 490 business profits of a group of entities conducting a unitary 491 business. Under this method, the net income of the entities must 492 be added together, along with the additions and subtractions 493 under s. 220.13, and apportioned to this state as a single 494 taxpayer under ss. 220.15 and 220.151. However, each special 495 industry member included in a unitary combined group return 496 which would otherwise be permitted to use a special method of 497 apportionment under s. 220.151 shall convert its single-factor 498 apportionment to a three-factor apportionment of property, 499 payroll, and sales. The special industry member shall calculate 500 the denominator of its property, payroll, and sales factors in 501 the same manner as those denominators are calculated by members 502 that are not special industry members. The numerator of sales, 503 property, and payroll factors is the product of the denominator 504 of each factor multiplied by the premiums or revenue-miles 505 factor ratio otherwise applicable under s. 220.151. 506 (2)âAll members of a unitary combined group must use the 507 unitary combined reporting method, under which all of the 508 following apply: 509 (a)âAdjusted federal income, for purposes of s. 220.12, is 510 the sum of adjusted federal income of all members of the unitary 511 combined group as determined for a concurrent taxable year. 512 (b)âThe numerators and denominators of the apportionment 513 factors must be calculated for all members of the unitary 514 combined group combined. 515 (c)âIntercompany sales transactions between members of the 516 unitary combined group are not included in the numerator or 517 denominator of the sales factor under ss. 220.15 and 220.151, 518 regardless of whether indicia of a sale exist. 519 (d)âFor sales of intangibles, including, but not limited 520 to, accounts receivable, notes, bonds, and stock, which are made 521 to entities outside the group, only the net proceeds are 522 included in the numerator and denominator of the sales factor. 523 524 As used in this subsection, the term âsaleâ includes, but is not 525 limited to, loans, payments for the use of intangibles, 526 dividends, and management fees. 527 (3)(a)âIf a parent corporation is a member of the unitary 528 combined group and has nexus with this state, a single unitary 529 combined group return must be filed in the name and under the 530 federal employer identification number of the parent 531 corporation. If the unitary combined group does not have a 532 parent corporation, if the parent corporation is not a member of 533 the unitary combined group, or if the parent corporation does 534 not have nexus with this state, the members of the unitary 535 combined group must choose a member subject to the tax imposed 536 by this chapter to file the return. The members of the unitary 537 combined group may not choose another member to file a corporate 538 income tax return in subsequent years unless the filing member 539 does not maintain nexus with this state or does not remain a 540 member of the unitary combined group. The return must be signed 541 by an authorized officer of the filing member as the agent for 542 the unitary combined group. 543 (b)âIf members of a unitary combined group have different 544 taxable years, the taxable year of a majority of the members of 545 the unitary combined group is the taxable year of the unitary 546 combined group. If the taxable years of a majority of the 547 members of a unitary combined group do not correspond, the 548 taxable year of the member that files the return for the unitary 549 combined group is the taxable year of the unitary combined 550 group. 551 (c)1.âA member of a unitary combined group having a taxable 552 year that does not correspond to the taxable year of the unitary 553 combined group shall determine its income for inclusion on the 554 tax return of the unitary combined group using all of the 555 following: 556 a.âThe precise amount of taxable income received during the 557 months corresponding to the taxable year of the unitary combined 558 group, if the precise amount can be readily determined from the 559 memberâs books and records. 560 b.âThe taxable income of the member converted to conform to 561 the taxable year of the unitary combined group on the basis of 562 the number of months falling within the taxable year of the 563 unitary combined group. For example, if the taxable year of the 564 unitary combined group is a calendar year and a member operates 565 on a fiscal year ending on April 30, the income of the member 566 must include 8/12 of the income from the current taxable year 567 and 4/12 of the income from the preceding taxable year. This 568 method to determine the income of a member may be used only if 569 the return can be timely filed after the end of the taxable year 570 of the unitary combined group. 571 c.âThe taxable income of the member during its taxable year 572 that ends within the taxable year of the unitary combined group. 573 2.âThe method of determining the income of a member of a 574 unitary combined group whose taxable year does not correspond to 575 the taxable year of the unitary combined group may not change as 576 long as the member remains a member of the unitary combined 577 group. The apportionment factors for the member must be applied 578 to the income of the member for the taxable year of the unitary 579 combined group. 580 (4)(a)âA unitary combined group return must include a 581 computational schedule that does all of the following: 582 1.âCombines the adjusted federal income of all members of 583 the unitary combined group; 584 2.âShows all intercompany eliminations; 585 3.âShows Florida additions and subtractions under s. 586 220.13; and 587 4.âShows the calculation of the combined apportionment 588 factors. 589 (b)âIn addition to its return, a unitary combined group 590 shall also file a domestic disclosure spreadsheet.

The Legislature intends to grant the department 612 extensive authority to adopt rules and forms describing and 613 defining principles for determining the existence of a unitary 614 combined group, definitions of common control, methods of 615 reporting, and related forms, principles, and other definitions. 616 Section 6.âSubsections (2), (3), and (4) of section 220.14, 617 Florida Statutes, are amended to read: 618 220.14âExemption.â 619 (2)âIn the case of a taxable year for a period of less than 620 12 months, the exemption allowed by this section must shall be 621 prorated on the basis of the number of days in such year to 365 622 days, or, in a leap year, 366 days. 623 (3)âOnly one exemption is shall be allowed to taxpayers 624 filing a unitary combined group consolidated return under this 625 code. 626 (4)âNotwithstanding any other provision of this code, not 627 more than one exemption under this section may be allowed to the 628 Florida members of a controlled group of corporations, as 629 defined in s. 1563 of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to 630 taxable years ending on or after December 31, 1970, filing 631 separate returns under this code.

That sales factor, expressed 671 only as a percentage and not in terms of the dollar volume of 672 sales, so as to protect the confidentiality of the sales of the 673 processor, shall be furnished on the request of such a grower 674 promptly after it has been determined for that taxable year. 675 3.âReimbursement of expenses under an agency contract 676 between a cooperative, a grower-member of a cooperative, or a 677 grower and a processor is not a sale within this state. 678 (c)âSales of a financial organization, including, but not 679 limited to, banking and savings institutions, investment 680 companies, real estate investment trusts, and brokerage 681 companies, occur in this state if derived from: 682 1.âFees, commissions, or other compensation for financial 683 services rendered within this state; 684 2.âGross profits from trading in stocks, bonds, or other 685 securities managed within this state; 686 3.âInterest received within this state, other than interest 687 from loans secured by mortgages, deeds of trust, or other liens 688 upon real or tangible personal property located without this 689 state, and dividends received within this state; 690 4.âInterest charged to customers at places of business 691 maintained within this state for carrying debit balances of 692 margin accounts, without deduction of any costs incurred in 693 carrying such accounts; 694 5.âInterest, fees, commissions, or other charges or gains 695 from loans secured by mortgages, deeds of trust, or other liens 696 upon real or tangible personal property located in this state or 697 from installment sale agreements originally executed by a 698 taxpayer or the taxpayerâs agent to sell real or tangible 699 personal property located in this state; 700 6.âRents from real or tangible personal property located in 701 this state; or 702 7.âAny other gross income, including other interest, 703 resulting from the operation as a financial organization within 704 this state. 705 706 In computing the amounts under this paragraph, any amount 707 received by a member of an affiliated group (determined under s. 708 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, but without reference to 709 whether any such corporation is an âincludable corporationâ 710 under s. 1504(b) of the Internal Revenue Code) from another 711 member of such group shall be included only to the extent such 712 amount exceeds expenses of the recipient directly related 713 thereto. 714 Section 8.âParagraph (f) of subsection (1) of section 715 220.183, Florida Statutes, is amended to read: 716 220.183âCommunity contribution tax credit.â 717 (1)âAUTHORIZATION TO GRANT COMMUNITY CONTRIBUTION TAX 718 CREDITS; LIMITATIONS ON INDIVIDUAL CREDITS AND PROGRAM 719 SPENDING.â 720 (f)âA taxpayer who files a Florida consolidated return as a 721 member of an affiliated group pursuant to s. 220.131(1) may be 722 allowed the credit on a consolidated return basis. 723 Section 9.âParagraphs (b), (c), and (d) of subsection (2) 724 of section 220.1845, Florida Statutes, are amended to read: 725 220.1845âContaminated site rehabilitation tax credit.â 726 (2)âAUTHORIZATION FOR TAX CREDIT; LIMITATIONS.â 727 (b)âA tax credit applicant, or multiple tax credit 728 applicants working jointly to clean up a single site, may not be 729 granted more than $500,000 per year in tax credits for each site 730 voluntarily rehabilitated.

A corporation having less than 50 475 percent of its outstanding voting stock directly or indirectly 476 owned or controlled by a unitary combined group is considered a 477 member of the unitary combined group if the business activities 478 of the corporation are of such a nature that the corporation is 479 considered functionally integrated with, and therefore a member 480 of, the unitary combined group. All of the income of a 481 corporation that is a member of a unitary combined group is 482 unitary. For purposes of this section, the attribution rules of 483 26 U.S.C. s. 318 must be used to determine whether voting stock 484 is indirectly owned. 485 Section 5.âSection 220.1363, Florida Statutes, is created 486 to read: 487 220.1363âUnitary combined groups; special requirements.â 488 (1)âAs used in this section, the term âunitary combined 489 reporting methodâ means a method used to determine the taxable 490 business profits of a group of entities conducting a unitary 491 business.

However, each special 495 industry member included in a unitary combined group return 496 which would otherwise be permitted to use a special method of 497 apportionment under s. 220.151 shall convert its single-factor 498 apportionment to a three-factor apportionment of property, 499 payroll, and sales. The special industry member shall calculate 500 the denominator of its property, payroll, and sales factors in 501 the same manner as those denominators are calculated by members 502 that are not special industry members. The numerator of sales, 503 property, and payroll factors is the product of the denominator 504 of each factor multiplied by the premiums or revenue-miles 505 factor ratio otherwise applicable under s. 220.151. 506 (2)âAll members of a unitary combined group must use the 507 unitary combined reporting method, under which all of the 508 following apply: 509 (a)âAdjusted federal income, for purposes of s. 220.12, is 510 the sum of adjusted federal income of all members of the unitary 511 combined group as determined for a concurrent taxable year. 512 (b)âThe numerators and denominators of the apportionment 513 factors must be calculated for all members of the unitary 514 combined group combined. 515 (c)âIntercompany sales transactions between members of the 516 unitary combined group are not included in the numerator or 517 denominator of the sales factor under ss. 220.15 and 220.151, 518 regardless of whether indicia of a sale exist. 519 (d)âFor sales of intangibles, including, but not limited 520 to, accounts receivable, notes, bonds, and stock, which are made 521 to entities outside the group, only the net proceeds are 522 included in the numerator and denominator of the sales factor. 523 524 As used in this subsection, the term âsaleâ includes, but is not 525 limited to, loans, payments for the use of intangibles, 526 dividends, and management fees. 527 (3)(a)âIf a parent corporation is a member of the unitary 528 combined group and has nexus with this state, a single unitary 529 combined group return must be filed in the name and under the 530 federal employer identification number of the parent 531 corporation. If the unitary combined group does not have a 532 parent corporation, if the parent corporation is not a member of 533 the unitary combined group, or if the parent corporation does 534 not have nexus with this state, the members of the unitary 535 combined group must choose a member subject to the tax imposed 536 by this chapter to file the return. The members of the unitary 537 combined group may not choose another member to file a corporate 538 income tax return in subsequent years unless the filing member 539 does not maintain nexus with this state or does not remain a 540 member of the unitary combined group. The return must be signed 541 by an authorized officer of the filing member as the agent for 542 the unitary combined group. 543 (b)âIf members of a unitary combined group have different 544 taxable years, the taxable year of a majority of the members of 545 the unitary combined group is the taxable year of the unitary 546 combined group. If the taxable years of a majority of the 547 members of a unitary combined group do not correspond, the 548 taxable year of the member that files the return for the unitary 549 combined group is the taxable year of the unitary combined 550 group. 551 (c)1.âA member of a unitary combined group having a taxable 552 year that does not correspond to the taxable year of the unitary 553 combined group shall determine its income for inclusion on the 554 tax return of the unitary combined group using all of the 555 following: 556 a.âThe precise amount of taxable income received during the 557 months corresponding to the taxable year of the unitary combined 558 group, if the precise amount can be readily determined from the 559 memberâs books and records. 560 b.âThe taxable income of the member converted to conform to 561 the taxable year of the unitary combined group on the basis of 562 the number of months falling within the taxable year of the 563 unitary combined group. For example, if the taxable year of the 564 unitary combined group is a calendar year and a member operates 565 on a fiscal year ending on April 30, the income of the member 566 must include 8/12 of the income from the current taxable year 567 and 4/12 of the income from the preceding taxable year. This 568 method to determine the income of a member may be used only if 569 the return can be timely filed after the end of the taxable year 570 of the unitary combined group. 571 c.âThe taxable income of the member during its taxable year 572 that ends within the taxable year of the unitary combined group. 573 2.âThe method of determining the income of a member of a 574 unitary combined group whose taxable year does not correspond to 575 the taxable year of the unitary combined group may not change as 576 long as the member remains a member of the unitary combined 577 group. The apportionment factors for the member must be applied 578 to the income of the member for the taxable year of the unitary 579 combined group. 580 (4)(a)âA unitary combined group return must include a 581 computational schedule that does all of the following: 582 1.âCombines the adjusted federal income of all members of 583 the unitary combined group; 584 2.âShows all intercompany eliminations; 585 3.âShows Florida additions and subtractions under s. 586 220.13; and 587 4.âShows the calculation of the combined apportionment 588 factors. 589 (b)âIn addition to its return, a unitary combined group 590 shall also file a domestic disclosure spreadsheet.

The Legislature intends to grant the department 612 extensive authority to adopt rules and forms describing and 613 defining principles for determining the existence of a unitary 614 combined group, definitions of common control, methods of 615 reporting, and related forms, principles, and other definitions. 616 Section 6.âSubsections (2), (3), and (4) of section 220.14, 617 Florida Statutes, are amended to read: 618 220.14âExemption.â 619 (2)âIn the case of a taxable year for a period of less than 620 12 months, the exemption allowed by this section must shall be 621 prorated on the basis of the number of days in such year to 365 622 days, or, in a leap year, 366 days. 623 (3)âOnly one exemption is shall be allowed to taxpayers 624 filing a unitary combined group consolidated return under this 625 code. 626 (4)âNotwithstanding any other provision of this code, not 627 more than one exemption under this section may be allowed to the 628 Florida members of a controlled group of corporations, as 629 defined in s. 1563 of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to 630 taxable years ending on or after December 31, 1970, filing 631 separate returns under this code. The exemption described in 632 this section must shall be divided equally among such Florida 633 members of the group, unless all of such members consent, at 634 such time and in such manner as the department shall by 635 regulation prescribe, to an apportionment plan providing for an 636 unequal allocation of such exemption. 637 Section 7.âParagraphs (b) and (c) of subsection (5) of 638 section 220.15, Florida Statutes, are amended to read: 639 220.15âApportionment of adjusted federal income.â 640 (5)âThe sales factor is a fraction the numerator of which 641 is the total sales of the taxpayer in this state during the 642 taxable year or period and the denominator of which is the total 643 sales of the taxpayer everywhere during the taxable year or 644 period. 645 (b)1.âSales of tangible personal property occur in this 646 state if: 647 a.âThe property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser, 648 other than the United States Government, within this state, 649 regardless of the f.o.b. point, other conditions of the sale, or 650 ultimate destination of the property, unless shipment is made 651 via a common or contract carrier; or 652 b.âThe property is shipped from an office, a store, a 653 warehouse, a factory, or other place of storage in this state, 654 and the purchaser is the United States Government or the 655 taxpayer is not taxable in the purchaserâs state. 656 657 However, for industries in NAICS National Number 311411, if the 658 ultimate destination of the product is to a location outside 659 this state, regardless of the method of shipment or f.o.b. 660 point, the sale shall not be deemed to occur in this state.

That sales factor, expressed 671 only as a percentage and not in terms of the dollar volume of 672 sales, so as to protect the confidentiality of the sales of the 673 processor, shall be furnished on the request of such a grower 674 promptly after it has been determined for that taxable year. 675 3.âReimbursement of expenses under an agency contract 676 between a cooperative, a grower-member of a cooperative, or a 677 grower and a processor is not a sale within this state. 678 (c)âSales of a financial organization, including, but not 679 limited to, banking and savings institutions, investment 680 companies, real estate investment trusts, and brokerage 681 companies, occur in this state if derived from: 682 1.âFees, commissions, or other compensation for financial 683 services rendered within this state; 684 2.âGross profits from trading in stocks, bonds, or other 685 securities managed within this state; 686 3.âInterest received within this state, other than interest 687 from loans secured by mortgages, deeds of trust, or other liens 688 upon real or tangible personal property located without this 689 state, and dividends received within this state; 690 4.âInterest charged to customers at places of business 691 maintained within this state for carrying debit balances of 692 margin accounts, without deduction of any costs incurred in 693 carrying such accounts; 694 5.âInterest, fees, commissions, or other charges or gains 695 from loans secured by mortgages, deeds of trust, or other liens 696 upon real or tangible personal property located in this state or 697 from installment sale agreements originally executed by a 698 taxpayer or the taxpayerâs agent to sell real or tangible 699 personal property located in this state; 700 6.âRents from real or tangible personal property located in 701 this state; or 702 7.âAny other gross income, including other interest, 703 resulting from the operation as a financial organization within 704 this state. 705 706 In computing the amounts under this paragraph, any amount 707 received by a member of an affiliated group (determined under s. 708 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, but without reference to 709 whether any such corporation is an âincludable corporationâ 710 under s. 1504(b) of the Internal Revenue Code) from another 711 member of such group shall be included only to the extent such 712 amount exceeds expenses of the recipient directly related 713 thereto. 714 Section 8.âParagraph (f) of subsection (1) of section 715 220.183, Florida Statutes, is amended to read: 716 220.183âCommunity contribution tax credit.â 717 (1)âAUTHORIZATION TO GRANT COMMUNITY CONTRIBUTION TAX 718 CREDITS; LIMITATIONS ON INDIVIDUAL CREDITS AND PROGRAM 719 SPENDING.â 720 (f)âA taxpayer who files a Florida consolidated return as a 721 member of an affiliated group pursuant to s. 220.131(1) may be 722 allowed the credit on a consolidated return basis. 723 Section 9.âParagraphs (b), (c), and (d) of subsection (2) 724 of section 220.1845, Florida Statutes, are amended to read: 725 220.1845âContaminated site rehabilitation tax credit.â 726 (2)âAUTHORIZATION FOR TAX CREDIT; LIMITATIONS.â 727 (b)âA tax credit applicant, or multiple tax credit 728 applicants working jointly to clean up a single site, may not be 729 granted more than $500,000 per year in tax credits for each site 730 voluntarily rehabilitated.
