26 this act:
27 (9) "Compatibility" means a condition in which land uses
28 or conditions within the same land use category, as designated
29 in a local government's comprehensive plan, can reasonably

42 payment of a fee, charge, or exaction that is based on a
43 percentage of construction costs, site costs, or project
44 valuation.
45 (b) A local land development regulation that imposes a
46 fee, charge, or exaction in connection with the review,

59 residential development" means the development of one or more
60 parcels that are no more than 100 acres in size within a future
61 land use category that allows a residential use, as well as any
62 zoning district that allows a residential use, and which parcels
63 are contiguous with residential development on at least 50
64 percent of the parcels' boundaries. For purposes of this
65 paragraph, the term "contiguous" means touching, bordering, or
66 adjoining along a boundary and includes properties that would be
67 contiguous if not separated by a roadway, railroad, canal, or
68 other public easement.

70 development regulations to condition, delay, or deny the
71 approval of a proposed development for residential use on the
72 grounds that the development is not compatible if the
73 development is located adjacent to, or across a public right-of-
74 way from, an existing residential development within the same
75 land use category.
