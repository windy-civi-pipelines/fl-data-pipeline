  417         (2)âA person must be certified or registered in order to

  420  subcontractor who is not certified or registered may perform
  421  construction work under the supervision of a person who is
  422  certified or registered, provided that the work is within the
  423  scope of the supervising contractorâs license, the supervising
  424  contractor is responsible for the work, and the subcontractor
  425  being supervised is not engaged in construction work that would
  426  require a license as a contractor under any of the categories
  427  listed in s. 489.105(3)(d)-(o). This subsection does not affect
  428  the application of any local construction licensing ordinances.
  429  To enforce this subsection:
  430         (a)âThe department shall issue a cease and desist order to
  431  prohibit any person from engaging in the business of contracting
  432  who does not hold the required certification or registration for
  433  the work being performed under this part. For the purpose of

  451  defined in s. 489.105(3)(a)-(o) must be registered before
  452  engaging in business as a contractor in this state, unless he or
  453  she is certified. Except as provided in paragraph (2)(b), to be
  454  initially registered, the applicant must submit the required fee
  455  and file evidence of successful compliance with the local
  456  examination and licensing requirements, if any, in the area for
  457  which registration is desired. An examination is not required
  458  for registration.
  459         (2)(a)âExcept as provided in paragraph (b), the board may
  460  not issue a new registration after July 1, 1993, based on any
  461  certificate of competency or license for a category of
  462  contractor defined in s. 489.105(3)(a)-(o) which is issued by a
  463  municipal or county government that does not exercise
  464  disciplinary control and oversight over such locally licensed
  465  contractors, including forwarding a recommended order in each
  466  action to the board as provided in s. 489.131(7). For purposes
  467  of this subsection and s. 489.131(10), the board shall determine
  468  the adequacy of such disciplinary control by reviewing the local
  469  governmentâs ability to process and investigate complaints and
  470  to take disciplinary action against locally licensed
  471  contractors.
  472         (b)âThe board shall issue a registration to an eligible
  473  applicant to engage in the business of a contractor in a
  474  specified local jurisdiction, provided each of the following
  475  conditions are satisfied:
  476         1.âThe applicant held, in any local jurisdiction in this
  477  state during 2021, 2022, or 2023, a certificate of registration
  478  issued by the state or a local license issued by a local
  479  jurisdiction to perform work in a category of contractor defined
  480  in s. 489.105(3)(a)-(o).
  481         2.âThe applicant submits all of the following to the board:
  482         a.âEvidence of the certificate of registration or local
  483  license held by the applicant as required by subparagraph 1.
  484         b.âEvidence that the specified local jurisdiction does not
  485  have a license type available for the category of work for which
  486  the applicant was issued a certificate of registration or local
  487  license during 2021, 2022, or 2023, such as a notification on
  488  the website of the local jurisdiction or an e-mail or letter
  489  from the office of the local building official or local building
  490  department stating that such license type is not available in
  491  that local jurisdiction.
  492         c.âEvidence that the applicant has submitted the required
  493  fee.
  494         d.âEvidence of compliance with the insurance and financial
  495  responsibility requirements of s. 489.115(5).
  496  
  497  An examination is not required for an applicant seeking a
  498  registration under this paragraph.
  499         (4)(a)1.âA person whose job scope does not substantially
  500  correspond to either the job scope of one of the contractor
  501  categories defined in s. 489.105(3)(a)-(o), or the job scope of
  502  one of the certified specialty contractor categories established
  503  by board rule, is not required to register with the board. A
  504  local government, as defined in s. 163.211, may not require a
  505  person to obtain a license, issued by the local government or
  506  the state, for a job scope which does not substantially
  507  correspond to the job scope of one of the contractor categories
  508  defined in s. 489.105(3)(a)-(o) and (q) or authorized in s.
  509  489.1455(1), or the job scope of one of the certified specialty
  510  contractor categories established pursuant to s. 489.113(6). A
  511  local government may not require a state or local license to
  512  obtain a permit for such job scopes. For purposes of this
  513  section, job scopes for which a local government may not require
  514  a license include, but are not limited to, painting; flooring;
  515  cabinetry; interior remodeling when the scope of the project
  516  does not include a task for which a state license is required;
  517  driveway or tennis court installation; handyman services;
  518  decorative stone, tile, marble, granite, or terrazzo
  519  installation; plastering; pressure washing; stuccoing; caulking;
  520  and canvas awning and ornamental iron installation.
  521         2.âA county that includes an area designated as an area of
  522  critical state concern under s. 380.05 may offer a license for
  523  any job scope which requires a contractor license under this
  524  part if the county imposed such a licensing requirement before
  525  January 1, 2021.
  526         3.âA local government may continue to offer a license for
  527  veneer, including aluminum or vinyl gutters, siding, soffit, or
  528  fascia; rooftop painting, coating, and cleaning above three
  529  stories in height; or fence installation and erection if the
  530  local government imposed such a licensing requirement before
  531  January 1, 2021.
  532         4.âA local government may not require a license as a
  533  prerequisite to submit a bid for public works projects if the
  534  work to be performed does not require a license under general
  535  law.
  536         (d)âAny person who is not required to obtain registration
  537  or certification pursuant to s. 489.105(3)(d)-(o) may perform
  538  contracting services for the construction, remodeling, repair,
  539  or improvement of single-family residences, including a
  540  townhouse as defined in the Florida Building Code, without
  541  obtaining a local license if such person is under the
  542  supervision of a certified or registered general, building, or
  543  residential contractor. As used in this paragraph, supervision
  544  shall not be deemed to require the existence of a direct
  545  contract between the certified or registered general, building,
  546  or residential contractor and the person performing specialty
  547  contracting services.
  548         (e)âAny person who is not certified or registered may
  549  perform the work of a specialty contractor whose scope of
  550  practice is limited to the type of work specified under s.
  551  489.105(3)(j), (k), or (l) for the construction, remodeling,
  552  repair, or improvement of commercial or residential swimming
  553  pools, interactive water features as defined in the Florida
  554  Building Code, hot tubs, and spas without obtaining a local
  555  license or certification as a specialty contractor if he or she
  556  is supervised by a contractor who is certified or registered
  557  under s. 489.105(3)(j), (k), or (l); the work is within the
  558  scope of the supervising contractorâs license; the supervising
  559  contractor is responsible for the work; and the work does not
  560  require certification or registration under s. 489.105(3)(d)
  561  (i), (m)-(o), or s. 489.505. Such supervision does not require a
  562  direct contract between the contractor certified or registered
  563  under s. 489.105(3)(j), (k), or (l) and the person performing
  564  the work, or for the person performing the work to be an
  565  employee of the contractor certified or registered under s.
  566  489.105(3)(j), (k), or (l). This paragraph does not limit the
  567  exemptions provided in s. 489.103 and may not be construed to
  568  expand the scope of a contractor certified or registered under
