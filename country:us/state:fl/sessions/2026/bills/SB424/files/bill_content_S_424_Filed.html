   75  restrictions, such as parking and site-size criteria, student
   76  enrollment, and occupant load, that are addressed by and more
   77  stringent than those found in the State Requirements for
   78  Educational Facilities of the Florida Building Code. A local
   79  governing authority <u class="Insert">shall</u> <s class="Remove">must</s> treat schools of hope equitably
   80  in comparison to similar requirements, restrictions, and site
   81  planning processes imposed upon public schools. The agency
   82  having jurisdiction for inspection of a facility and issuance of
   83  a certificate of occupancy or use <u class="Insert">is</u> <s class="Remove">shall be</s> the local

   85  governing authority. If an official or employee of the local
   86  governing authority refuses to comply with this paragraph, the
   87  aggrieved school or entity has an immediate right to bring an
   88  action in circuit court to enforce its rights by injunction. An
   89  aggrieved party that receives injunctive relief may be awarded
   90  reasonable attorney fees and court costs.
   91         (d)âNo later than January 1, the department shall annually
   92  provide to school districts a list of all underused, vacant, or
   93  surplus facilities owned or operated by the school district as
   94  reported in the Florida Inventory of School Houses. A school
   95  district may provide evidence to the department that a facility
   96  includes prekindergarten students who are not reported for
   97  funding in the Florida Education Finance Program or that the
   98  list contains errors or omissions within 30 days after receipt
   99  of the list. By each April 1, the department shall update and
  100  publish a final list of all underused, vacant, or surplus
  101  facilities owned or operated by each school district, based upon
  102  updated information provided by each school district. <s class="Remove">A hope</s>
  103  <s class="Remove">operator establishing a school of hope may use an educational</s>
  104  <s class="Remove">facility identified in this paragraph at no cost.</s> A hope
  105  operator using a facility pursuant to this paragraph may not
  106  sell or dispose of such facility without the written permission
  107  of the school district. For purposes of this paragraph, the term
  108  âunderused, vacant, or surplus facilityâ means an entire
  109  facility or portion thereof which is not fully used or is used
