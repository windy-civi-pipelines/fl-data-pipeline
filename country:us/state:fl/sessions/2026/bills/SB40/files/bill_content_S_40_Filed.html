    1                        A bill to be entitled                      
    2         An act relating to Medicaid providers; amending s.
    3         409.967, F.S.; requiring the Agency for Health Care
    4         Administration to include specified requirements in
    5         its contracts with Medicaid managed care plans;
    6         defining the term âoutside of regular business hoursâ;
    7         providing an effective date.
    8          
    9  Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Florida:
   10  
   11         Section 1.âParagraph (c) of subsection (2) of section
   12  409.967, Florida Statutes, is amended to read:
   13         409.967âManaged care plan accountability.â
   14         (2)âThe agency shall establish such contract requirements
   15  as are necessary for the operation of the statewide managed care
   16  program. In addition to any other provisions the agency may deem
   17  necessary, the contract must require:
   18         (c)â<i>Access.</i>â
   19         1.âThe agency shall establish specific standards for the
   20  number, type, and regional distribution of providers in managed
   21  care plan networks to ensure access to care for both adults and
   22  children. Each plan must maintain a regionwide network of
   23  providers in sufficient numbers to meet the access standards for
   24  specific medical services for all recipients enrolled in the
   25  plan. The exclusive use of mail-order pharmacies may not be
   26  sufficient to meet network access standards. Consistent with the
   27  standards established by the agency, provider networks may
   28  include providers located outside the region.
   29         <u class="Insert">2.â</u><u class="Insert">The agency shall establish specific standards to ensure</u>
   30  <u class="Insert">enrollees have access to network providers during state holidays</u>
   31  <u class="Insert">and outside </u><u class="Insert">of </u><u class="Insert">regular business hours. At least 50 percent of</u>
   32  <u class="Insert">primary care providers participating in a plan provider network</u>
   33  <u class="Insert">must offer appointment availability to Medicaid enrollees</u>
   34  <u class="Insert">outside </u><u class="Insert">of </u><u class="Insert">regular business hours. For the purposes of this</u>
   35  <u class="Insert">subparagraph, the term âoutside </u><u class="Insert">of </u><u class="Insert">regular business hoursâ means</u>
   36  <u class="Insert">Monday through Friday between 5 p.m. and 8 a.m. local time and</u>
   37  <u class="Insert">all</u><u class="Insert"> </u><u class="Insert">day Saturday and Sunday.</u>
   38         <u class="Insert">3.</u>âEach plan shall establish and maintain an accurate and
   39  complete electronic database of contracted providers, including
   40  information about licensure or registration, locations and hours
   41  of operation, specialty credentials and other certifications,
   42  specific performance indicators, and such other information as
   43  the agency deems necessary. The database must be available
   44  online to both the agency and the public and have the capability
   45  to compare the availability of providers to network adequacy
   46  standards and to accept and display feedback from each
   47  providerâs patients.
   48         <u class="Insert">4.</u>âEach plan shall submit quarterly reports to the agency
   49  identifying the number of enrollees assigned to each primary
   50  care provider.
   51         <u class="Insert">5.</u>âThe agency shall conduct, or contract for, systematic
   52  and continuous testing of the provider network databases
   53  maintained by each plan to confirm accuracy, confirm that
   54  behavioral health providers are accepting enrollees, and confirm
   55  that enrollees have access to behavioral health services.
   56         <u class="Insert">6.</u><s class="Remove">2.</s>âEach managed care plan <u class="Insert">shall</u> <s class="Remove">must</s> publish any
   57  prescribed drug formulary or preferred drug list on the planâs
   58  website in a manner that is accessible to and searchable by
   59  enrollees and providers. The plan must update the list within 24
   60  hours after making a change. Each plan must ensure that the
   61  prior authorization process for prescribed drugs is readily
   62  accessible to health care providers, including posting
   63  appropriate contact information on its website and providing
   64  timely responses to providers. For Medicaid recipients diagnosed
   65  with hemophilia who have been prescribed anti-hemophilic-factor
   66  replacement products, the agency shall provide for those
   67  products and hemophilia overlay services through the agencyâs
   68  hemophilia disease management program.
   69         <u class="Insert">7.</u><s class="Remove">3.</s>âManaged care plans, and their fiscal agents or

   76  to the department or the applicable contracted community-based
   77  care lead agency for use in providing comprehensive and
   78  coordinated case management. The agency and the department shall
   79  establish an interagency agreement to provide guidance for the
   80  format, confidentiality, recipient, scope, and method of
   81  information to be made available and the deadlines for
   82  submission of the data. The scope of information available to
   83  the department <u class="Insert">is</u> <s class="Remove">shall be</s> the data that managed care plans are
   84  required to submit to the agency. The agency shall determine the

   86  and behavioral health services; the use of medications; and
   87  <u class="Insert">follow up</u> <s class="Remove">followup</s> on all medically necessary services
   88  recommended as a result of early and periodic screening,
