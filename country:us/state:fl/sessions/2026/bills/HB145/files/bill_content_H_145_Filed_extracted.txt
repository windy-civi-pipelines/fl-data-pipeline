206 seeking contribution has either discharged the common liability
207 by payment or agreed, while the action is pending against her or
208 him, to discharge the common liability; or
209 2. Such action arises from a violation of s. 794.011
210 involving a victim who was under the age of 16 years at the time
211 of the act, the claimant may present the claim in writing at any
212 time. This subparagraph applies to any such action other than an

226 or subdivision, may be excused by the court upon a showing by
227 the preponderance of the evidence of the claimant's lack of
228 knowledge of an adjudicated claim and reasonable inquiry by, or
229 on behalf of, the claimant to obtain the information from public
230 records. Unless the appropriate agency had actual notice of the
231 information required to be disclosed by paragraph (c) in time to
232 assert a setoff, an unexcused failure to disclose shall, upon
233 hearing and order of court, cause the claimant to be liable for
234 double the original undisclosed judgment and, upon further
235 motion, the court shall enter judgment for the agency in that
236 amount. Except as provided otherwise in this subsection, the
237 failure of the Department of Financial Services or the
238 appropriate agency to make final disposition of a claim within 4
239 6 months after it is filed shall be deemed a final denial of the
240 claim for purposes of this section. For purposes of this
241 subsection, in medical malpractice actions and in wrongful death
242 actions, the failure of the Department of Financial Services or

244 within 90 days after it is filed shall be deemed a final denial
245 of the claim. The statute of limitations for medical malpractice
246 actions and wrongful death actions is tolled as to all

405 insurance through a self-insurance program, the county must also
406 provide the sheriff with commercial stop-loss coverage in an
407 amount and with a self-insured retention agreed upon by the
408 sheriff and the county.
409 (IV) Legal representation and advice through the office of
410 the county attorney for all claims, demands, and causes of
411 action brought against the sheriff, his or her deputies, or
412 other personnel in their official and individual capacities,

433 sheriff does not create a joint-employer relationship. The
434 sheriff's employees shall remain members of the county's health
435 insurance and workers' compensation plans for at least the term
436 set forth in this subparagraph.
437 (VIII) Fleet management, including procurement of all

454 establish the office of the sheriff in a manner that minimizes
455 unnecessary financial expenditures, the county and the sheriff
456 shall execute an interlocal agreement addressing the

1164 costs for claims brought against the entity or its subcontractor

1234 409.993 Lead agencies and subcontractor liability.—
1235 (1) FINDINGS.—
1236 (a) The Legislature finds that the state has traditionally
1237 provided foster care services to children who are the
1238 responsibility of the state. As such, foster children have not
1239 had the right to recover for injuries beyond the limitations
1240 specified in s. 768.28. The Legislature has determined that
1241 foster care and related services should be outsourced pursuant
1242 to this section and that the provision of such services is of
1243 paramount importance to the state. The purpose of such
1244 outsourcing is to increase the level of safety, security, and
1245 stability of children who are or become the responsibility of
1246 the state. One of the components necessary to secure a safe and
1247 stable environment for such children is the requirement that
1248 private providers maintain liability insurance. As such,
1249 insurance needs to be available and remain available to
1250 nongovernmental foster care and related services providers

HB 145 2026
1251 without the resources of such providers being significantly
1252 reduced by the cost of maintaining such insurance.
1253 (b) The Legislature further finds that, by requiring the
1254 following minimum levels of insurance, children in outsourced
1255 foster care and related services will gain increased protection
1256 and rights of recovery in the event of injury than currently
1257 provided in s. 768.28.
1258 (2) LEAD AGENCY LIABILITY.—
1259 (a) Other than an entity to which s. 768.28 applies, an
1260 eligible community-based care lead agency, or its employees or
1261 officers, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b), shall,
1262 as a part of its contract, obtain a minimum of $1 million per
1263 occurrence with a policy period aggregate limit of $3 million in
1264 general liability insurance coverage. The lead agency must also
1265 require that staff who transport client children and families in
1266 their personal automobiles in order to carry out their job
1267 responsibilities obtain minimum bodily injury liability
1268 insurance in the amount of $100,000 per person per any one
1269 automobile accident, and subject to such limits for each person,
1270 $300,000 for all damages resulting from any one automobile
1271 accident, on their personal automobiles. In lieu of personal
1272 motor vehicle insurance, the lead agency's casualty, liability,
1273 or motor vehicle insurance carrier may provide nonowned
1274 automobile liability coverage. This insurance provides liability
1275 insurance for an automobile that the lead agency uses in

1276 connection with the lead agency's business but does not own,
1277 lease, rent, or borrow. This coverage includes an automobile
1278 owned by an employee of the lead agency or a member of the
1279 employee's household but only while the automobile is used in
1280 connection with the lead agency's business. The nonowned
1281 automobile coverage for the lead agency applies as excess
1282 coverage over any other collectible insurance. The personal
1283 automobile policy for the employee of the lead agency shall be
1284 primary insurance, and the nonowned automobile coverage of the
1285 lead agency acts as excess insurance to the primary insurance.
1286 The lead agency shall provide a minimum limit of $1 million in
1287 nonowned automobile coverage. In a tort action brought against
1288 such a lead agency or employee, net economic damages shall be
1289 limited to $2 million per liability claim and $200,000 per
1290 automobile claim, including, but not limited to, past and future
1291 medical expenses, wage loss, and loss of earning capacity,
1292 offset by any collateral source payment paid or payable. In any
1293 tort action brought against a lead agency, noneconomic damages
1294 shall be limited to $400,000 per claim. A claims bill may be
1295 brought on behalf of a claimant pursuant to s. 768.28 for any
1296 amount exceeding the limits specified in this paragraph. Any
1297 offset of collateral source payments made as of the date of the
1298 settlement or judgment shall be in accordance with s. 768.76.
1299 The lead agency is not liable in tort for the acts or omissions
1300 of its subcontractors or the officers, agents, or employees of

1302 (3) SUBCONTRACTOR LIABILITY.—
1303 (a) A subcontractor of an eligible community-based care
1304 lead agency that is a direct provider of foster care and related
1305 services to children and families, and its employees or
1306 officers, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c), must,
1307 as a part of its contract, obtain a minimum of $1 million per
1308 occurrence with a policy period aggregate limit of $3 million in
1309 general liability insurance coverage. The subcontractor of a
1310 lead agency must also require that staff who transport client
1311 children and families in their personal automobiles in order to
1312 carry out their job responsibilities obtain minimum bodily
1313 injury liability insurance in the amount of $100,000 per person
1314 in any one automobile accident, and subject to such limits for
1315 each person, $300,000 for all damages resulting from any one
1316 automobile accident, on their personal automobiles. In lieu of
1317 personal motor vehicle insurance, the subcontractor's casualty,
1318 liability, or motor vehicle insurance carrier may provide
1319 nonowned automobile liability coverage. This insurance provides
1320 liability insurance for automobiles that the subcontractor uses
1321 in connection with the subcontractor's business but does not
1322 own, lease, rent, or borrow. This coverage includes automobiles
1323 owned by the employees of the subcontractor or a member of the
1324 employee's household but only while the automobiles are used in
1325 connection with the subcontractor's business. The nonowned

1326 automobile coverage for the subcontractor applies as excess
1327 coverage over any other collectible insurance. The personal
1328 automobile policy for the employee of the subcontractor shall be
1329 primary insurance, and the nonowned automobile coverage of the
1330 subcontractor acts as excess insurance to the primary insurance.
1331 The subcontractor shall provide a minimum limit of $1 million in
1332 nonowned automobile coverage. In a tort action brought against
1333 such subcontractor or employee, net economic damages shall be
1334 limited to $2 million per liability claim and $200,000 per
1335 automobile claim, including, but not limited to, past and future
1336 medical expenses, wage loss, and loss of earning capacity,
1337 offset by any collateral source payment paid or payable. In a
1338 tort action brought against such subcontractor, noneconomic
1339 damages shall be limited to $400,000 per claim. A claims bill
1340 may be brought on behalf of a claimant pursuant to s. 768.28 for
1341 any amount exceeding the limits specified in this paragraph. Any
1342 offset of collateral source payments made as of the date of the

203 against the tortfeasor seeking contribution has become final by
204 lapse of time for appeal or after appellate review or, if there
205 is no such judgment, within 6 months after the tortfeasor
206 seeking contribution has either discharged the common liability
207 by payment or agreed, while the action is pending against her or
208 him, to discharge the common liability; or
209 2. Such action arises from a violation of s. 794.011
210 involving a victim who was under the age of 16 years at the time
211 of the act, the claimant may present the claim in writing at any
212 time. This subparagraph applies to any such action other than an
213 action that would have been time barred on or before October 1,

226 or subdivision, may be excused by the court upon a showing by
227 the preponderance of the evidence of the claimant's lack of
228 knowledge of an adjudicated claim and reasonable inquiry by, or
229 on behalf of, the claimant to obtain the information from public
230 records. Unless the appropriate agency had actual notice of the
231 information required to be disclosed by paragraph (c) in time to
232 assert a setoff, an unexcused failure to disclose shall, upon
233 hearing and order of court, cause the claimant to be liable for
234 double the original undisclosed judgment and, upon further
235 motion, the court shall enter judgment for the agency in that
236 amount. Except as provided otherwise in this subsection, the
237 failure of the Department of Financial Services or the
238 appropriate agency to make final disposition of a claim within 4
239 6 months after it is filed shall be deemed a final denial of the
240 claim for purposes of this section. For purposes of this
241 subsection, in medical malpractice actions and in wrongful death
242 actions, the failure of the Department of Financial Services or
243 the appropriate agency to make final disposition of a claim
244 within 90 days after it is filed shall be deemed a final denial
245 of the claim. The statute of limitations for medical malpractice
246 actions and wrongful death actions is tolled as to all
247 prospective defendants for the period of time taken by the
248 Department of Financial Services or the appropriate agency to
249 deny the claim. The provisions of this subsection do not apply
250 to such claims as may be asserted by counterclaim pursuant to s.

406 provide the sheriff with commercial stop-loss coverage in an
407 amount and with a self-insured retention agreed upon by the
408 sheriff and the county.
409 (IV) Legal representation and advice through the office of
410 the county attorney for all claims, demands, and causes of
411 action brought against the sheriff, his or her deputies, or
412 other personnel in their official and individual capacities,

433 sheriff does not create a joint-employer relationship. The
434 sheriff's employees shall remain members of the county's health
435 insurance and workers' compensation plans for at least the term

453 d. To satisfy compliance with this subsection and to
454 establish the office of the sheriff in a manner that minimizes
455 unnecessary financial expenditures, the county and the sheriff
456 shall execute an interlocal agreement addressing the
457 requirements of this subsection and other expenditures,
458 including an appropriate phase-in period for identification of
459 the sheriff's assets with the sheriff's markings to minimize the
460 cost to taxpayers. The interlocal agreement shall have a term
461 that ends no earlier than September 30, 2028, and may be
462 amended, renewed, extended, or newly adopted at any time
463 following the expiration or termination of the agreement. After
464 the initial period ending no earlier than September 30, 2028, an
465 interlocal agreement may be entered into between the county and

1234 409.993 Lead agencies and subcontractor liability.—
1235 (1) FINDINGS.—
1236 (a) The Legislature finds that the state has traditionally
1237 provided foster care services to children who are the
1238 responsibility of the state. As such, foster children have not
1239 had the right to recover for injuries beyond the limitations
1240 specified in s. 768.28. The Legislature has determined that
1241 foster care and related services should be outsourced pursuant
1242 to this section and that the provision of such services is of
1243 paramount importance to the state. The purpose of such
1244 outsourcing is to increase the level of safety, security, and
1245 stability of children who are or become the responsibility of
1246 the state. One of the components necessary to secure a safe and
1247 stable environment for such children is the requirement that
1248 private providers maintain liability insurance. As such,
1249 insurance needs to be available and remain available to
1250 nongovernmental foster care and related services providers

HB 145 2026
1251 without the resources of such providers being significantly
1252 reduced by the cost of maintaining such insurance.
1253 (b) The Legislature further finds that, by requiring the
1254 following minimum levels of insurance, children in outsourced
1255 foster care and related services will gain increased protection
1256 and rights of recovery in the event of injury than currently
1257 provided in s. 768.28.
1258 (2) LEAD AGENCY LIABILITY.—
1259 (a) Other than an entity to which s. 768.28 applies, an
1260 eligible community-based care lead agency, or its employees or
1261 officers, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b), shall,
1262 as a part of its contract, obtain a minimum of $1 million per
1263 occurrence with a policy period aggregate limit of $3 million in
1264 general liability insurance coverage. The lead agency must also
1265 require that staff who transport client children and families in
1266 their personal automobiles in order to carry out their job
1267 responsibilities obtain minimum bodily injury liability
1268 insurance in the amount of $100,000 per person per any one
1269 automobile accident, and subject to such limits for each person,
1270 $300,000 for all damages resulting from any one automobile
1271 accident, on their personal automobiles. In lieu of personal
1272 motor vehicle insurance, the lead agency's casualty, liability,
1273 or motor vehicle insurance carrier may provide nonowned
1274 automobile liability coverage. This insurance provides liability
1275 insurance for an automobile that the lead agency uses in

1276 connection with the lead agency's business but does not own,
1277 lease, rent, or borrow. This coverage includes an automobile
1278 owned by an employee of the lead agency or a member of the
1279 employee's household but only while the automobile is used in
1280 connection with the lead agency's business. The nonowned
1281 automobile coverage for the lead agency applies as excess
1282 coverage over any other collectible insurance. The personal
1283 automobile policy for the employee of the lead agency shall be
1284 primary insurance, and the nonowned automobile coverage of the
1285 lead agency acts as excess insurance to the primary insurance.
1286 The lead agency shall provide a minimum limit of $1 million in
1287 nonowned automobile coverage. In a tort action brought against
1288 such a lead agency or employee, net economic damages shall be
1289 limited to $2 million per liability claim and $200,000 per
1290 automobile claim, including, but not limited to, past and future
1291 medical expenses, wage loss, and loss of earning capacity,
1292 offset by any collateral source payment paid or payable. In any
1293 tort action brought against a lead agency, noneconomic damages
1294 shall be limited to $400,000 per claim. A claims bill may be
1295 brought on behalf of a claimant pursuant to s. 768.28 for any
1296 amount exceeding the limits specified in this paragraph. Any
1297 offset of collateral source payments made as of the date of the
1298 settlement or judgment shall be in accordance with s. 768.76.
1299 The lead agency is not liable in tort for the acts or omissions
1300 of its subcontractors or the officers, agents, or employees of

1302 (3) SUBCONTRACTOR LIABILITY.—
1303 (a) A subcontractor of an eligible community-based care
1304 lead agency that is a direct provider of foster care and related
1305 services to children and families, and its employees or
1306 officers, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c), must,
1307 as a part of its contract, obtain a minimum of $1 million per
1308 occurrence with a policy period aggregate limit of $3 million in
1309 general liability insurance coverage. The subcontractor of a
1310 lead agency must also require that staff who transport client
1311 children and families in their personal automobiles in order to
1312 carry out their job responsibilities obtain minimum bodily
1313 injury liability insurance in the amount of $100,000 per person
1314 in any one automobile accident, and subject to such limits for
1315 each person, $300,000 for all damages resulting from any one
1316 automobile accident, on their personal automobiles. In lieu of
1317 personal motor vehicle insurance, the subcontractor's casualty,
1318 liability, or motor vehicle insurance carrier may provide
1319 nonowned automobile liability coverage. This insurance provides
1320 liability insurance for automobiles that the subcontractor uses
1321 in connection with the subcontractor's business but does not
1322 own, lease, rent, or borrow. This coverage includes automobiles
1323 owned by the employees of the subcontractor or a member of the
1324 employee's household but only while the automobiles are used in
1325 connection with the subcontractor's business. The nonowned

1326 automobile coverage for the subcontractor applies as excess
1327 coverage over any other collectible insurance. The personal
1328 automobile policy for the employee of the subcontractor shall be
1329 primary insurance, and the nonowned automobile coverage of the
1330 subcontractor acts as excess insurance to the primary insurance.
1331 The subcontractor shall provide a minimum limit of $1 million in
1332 nonowned automobile coverage. In a tort action brought against
1333 such subcontractor or employee, net economic damages shall be
1334 limited to $2 million per liability claim and $200,000 per
1335 automobile claim, including, but not limited to, past and future
1336 medical expenses, wage loss, and loss of earning capacity,
1337 offset by any collateral source payment paid or payable. In a
1338 tort action brought against such subcontractor, noneconomic
1339 damages shall be limited to $400,000 per claim. A claims bill
1340 may be brought on behalf of a claimant pursuant to s. 768.28 for
1341 any amount exceeding the limits specified in this paragraph. Any
