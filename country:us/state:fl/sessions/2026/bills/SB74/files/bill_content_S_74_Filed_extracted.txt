The 629 administrator of the data system shall promptly notify the home 630 state and all other member states of any adverse actions taken 631 by remote states. 632 (9)âThe compact does not override a member stateâs decision 633 that participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu 634 of adverse action. 635 (10)âThe compact does not authorize a member state to 636 demand the issuance of subpoenas for attendance and testimony of 637 witnesses or the production of evidence from another member 638 state for lawful actions within that member state. 639 (11)âThe compact does not authorize a member state to 640 impose discipline against a regulated social worker who holds a 641 multistate authorization to practice for actions committed in 642 another member state which were lawful in that state. 643 644 ARTICLE X 645 ESTABLISHMENT OF SOCIAL WORK LICENSURE COMPACT COMMISSION 646 647 (1)âThe compact member states hereby create and establish a 648 joint government agency whose membership consists of all member 649 states that have enacted the compact, to be known as the Social 650 Work Licensure Compact Commission.

A rule is invalid and has no force or 976 effect if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the rule 977 is invalid because the commission exercised its rulemaking 978 authority in a manner that is beyond the scope and purposes of 979 the compact, or the powers granted hereunder, or based upon 980 another applicable standard of review. 981 (2)âThe rules of the commission have the force of law in 982 each member state; however, if the rules of the commission 983 conflict with the laws, regulations, or applicable standards of 984 a member state governing the practice of social work as held by 985 a court of competent jurisdiction, the rules of the commission 986 are ineffective in that state to the extent of the conflict. 987 (3)âThe commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers 988 pursuant to the criteria set forth in this article and the rules 989 adopted hereunder. Rules become binding the day after they are 990 adopted or the date specified in the rule or amendment, 991 whichever is later. 992 (4)âIf a majority of the legislatures of the member states 993 rejects a rule or portion of a rule, by enactment of a statute 994 or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact 995 within 4 years after the date of adoption of the rule, such rule 996 has no further force and effect in any member state. 997 (5)âRules must be adopted at a regular or special meeting 998 of the commission. 999 (6)âBefore adoption of a proposed rule, the commission 1000 shall hold a public hearing and allow persons to provide oral 1001 and written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments. 1002 (7)âBefore adoption of a proposed rule by the commission, 1003 and at least 30 days before the meeting at which the commission 1004 will hold a public hearing on the proposed rule, the commission 1005 shall provide a notice of proposed rulemaking: 1006 (a)âOn the website of the commission or on another publicly 1007 accessible platform; 1008 (b)âTo persons who have requested notice of the 1009 commissionâs notices of proposed rulemaking; and 1010 (c)âIn any other manner as specified by commission rule. 1011 (8)âThe notice of proposed rulemaking must include all of 1012 the following: 1013 (a)âThe time, date, and location of the public hearing at 1014 which the commission will hear public comments on the proposed 1015 rule and, if different, the time, date, and location of the 1016 meeting where the commission will consider and vote on the 1017 proposed rule. 1018 (b)âIf the hearing is held through telecommunication, video 1019 conference, or other similar electronic means, the mechanism for 1020 accessing the hearing must be included in the notice of proposed 1021 rulemaking. 1022 (c)âThe text of the proposed rule and the reasons 1023 necessitating the rule. 1024 (d)âA request for comments on the proposed rule from any 1025 interested person. 1026 (e)âThe manner in which interested persons may submit 1027 written comments. 1028 (9)âAll hearings must be recorded. A copy of the recording 1029 and all written comments and documents received by the 1030 commission in response to the proposed rule must be made 1031 available to the public. 1032 (10)âThis article does not require a separate hearing on 1033 each rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the 1034 commission at hearings required by this article. 1035 (11)âThe commission shall, by majority vote of all members, 1036 take final action on the proposed rule based on the rulemaking 1037 record and the full text of the rule. 1038 (a)âThe commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule 1039 if the changes do not expand the original purpose of the 1040 proposed rule. 1041 (b)âThe commission shall provide an explanation of the 1042 reasons for substantive changes made to the proposed rule as 1043 well as the reasons why substantive changes recommended by 1044 commenters were not made. 1045 (c)âThe commission shall set a reasonable effective date 1046 for each rule. Except for an emergency as provided in subsection 1047 (12), the effective date of the rule must be at least 30 days 1048 after the commission issues the notice of rule adoption or 1049 amendment. 1050 (12)âUpon determination that an emergency exists, the 1051 commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule with 48 1052 hoursâ notice, with opportunity to comment, provided that the 1053 usual rulemaking procedures provided in the compact and in this 1054 article are retroactively applied to the rule as soon as 1055 reasonably possible, but in no event later than 90 days after 1056 the effective date of the rule. For purposes of this subsection, 1057 an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately in 1058 order to: 1059 (a)âMeet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or 1060 welfare; 1061 (b)âPrevent a loss of commission or member state funds; 1062 (c)âMeet a deadline for the adoption of a rule which is 1063 established by federal law or rule; or 1064 (d)âProtect public health and safety. 1065 (13)âThe commission or an authorized committee of the 1066 commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted rule for 1067 purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, 1068 errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of 1069 any revision must be posted on the commissionâs website. The 1070 revision is subject to challenge by any person for a period of 1071 30 days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on 1072 the grounds that the revision results in a material change to a 1073 rule. A challenge must be made in writing and delivered to the 1074 commission before the end of the notice period. If a challenge 1075 is not made, the revision will take effect without further 1076 action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take 1077 effect without the approval of the commission. 1078 (14)âA member stateâs rulemaking requirements do not apply 1079 under this compact. 1080 1081 ARTICLE XIII 1082 OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT 1083 1084 (1)(a)âThe executive and judicial branches of state 1085 government in each member state shall enforce the compact and 1086 take all actions necessary to implement the compact. 1087 (b)âExcept as otherwise provided in the compact, venue is 1088 proper and judicial proceedings by or against the commission 1089 shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent 1090 jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is 1091 located. The commission may waive venue and jurisdictional 1092 defenses to the extent that it adopts or consents to participate 1093 in alternative dispute resolution proceedings. This paragraph 1094 does not affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in 1095 any action against a licensee for professional malpractice, 1096 misconduct, or any such similar matter. 1097 (c)âThe commission is entitled to receive service of 1098 process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or 1099 interpretation of the compact and has standing to intervene in 1100 such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the 1101 commission service of process renders a judgment or an order 1102 void as to the commission, the compact, or adopted rules. 1103 (2)(a)âIf the commission determines that a member state has 1104 defaulted in the performance of its obligations or 1105 responsibilities under the compact or the adopted rules, the 1106 commission must provide written notice to the defaulting state. 1107 The notice of default must describe the default, the proposed 1108 means of curing the default, and any other action that the 1109 commission may take, and must offer training and specific 1110 technical assistance regarding the default. 1111 (b)âThe commission shall provide a copy of the notice of 1112 default to the other member states. 1113 (c)âIf a state in default fails to cure the default, the 1114 defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an 1115 affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the member 1116 states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred on 1117 that state by the compact may be terminated on the effective 1118 date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the 1119 offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during 1120 the period of default. 1121 (d)âTermination of membership in the compact may be imposed 1122 only after all other means of securing compliance have been 1123 exhausted. The commission shall give notice of intent to suspend 1124 or terminate to the Governor of the defaulting state, the 1125 majority and minority leaders of the defaulting stateâs 1126 legislature, the defaulting stateâs licensing authority, and the 1127 licensing authority of each member state. 1128 (e)âA state that has its membership terminated from the 1129 compact is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and 1130 liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, 1131 including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of 1132 termination. 1133 (f)âUpon the termination of a stateâs membership from the 1134 compact, that state shall immediately provide notice to all 1135 licensees within that state of such termination. The terminated 1136 state shall continue to recognize all licenses granted under the 1137 compact for at least 180 days after the date of the notice of 1138 termination. 1139 (g)âThe commission does not bear any costs related to a 1140 state that is found to be in default or that has been terminated 1141 from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the 1142 commission and the defaulting state. 1143 (h)âThe defaulting state may appeal the action of the 1144 commission by petitioning the United States District Court for 1145 the District of Columbia or the federal district where the 1146 commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall 1147 be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable 1148 attorney fees. 1149 (3)(a)âUpon request by a member state, the commission shall 1150 attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact which arise 1151 among member states and between member and nonmember states. 1152 (b)âThe commission shall adopt a rule providing for both 1153 mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes, as 1154 appropriate. 1155 (4)(a)âBy majority vote as provided by rule, the commission 1156 may initiate legal action against a member state in default in 1157 the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or 1158 the federal district where the commission has its principal 1159 offices to enforce compliance with the compact and its adopted 1160 rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and 1161 damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the 1162 prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, 1163 including reasonable attorney fees. The remedies herein are not 1164 the exclusive remedies of the commission. The commission may 1165 pursue any other remedies available under federal law or the 1166 defaulting member stateâs law. 1167 (b)âA member state may initiate legal action against the 1168 commission in the United States District Court for the District 1169 of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its 1170 principal offices to enforce compliance with the compact and its 1171 adopted rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive 1172 relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is 1173 necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of 1174 such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. 1175 (c)âOnly a member state may seek enforcement of the compact 1176 against the commission. 1177 1178 ARTICLE XIV 1179 EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT 1180 1181 (1)âThe compact becomes effective on the date the compact 1182 statute is enacted into law in the seventh member state. 1183 (2)(a)âOn or after the effective date of the compact, the 1184 commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of the 1185 first seven charter member states to determine whether the 1186 statute enacted by each such charter member state is materially 1187 different from the model compact language. 1188 1.âA charter member state whose enactment is found to be 1189 materially different from the model compact language is entitled 1190 to the default process set forth in Article XIII. 1191 2.âIf any member state is later found to be in default or 1192 is terminated or withdraws from the compact, the commission 1193 remains in existence and the compact remains in effect even if 1194 the number of member states is less than seven. 1195 (b)âMember states enacting the compact after the seven 1196 initial charter member states are subject to the process set 1197 forth in paragraph (3)(u) of Article X to determine whether 1198 their enactments are materially different from the model compact 1199 language and whether they qualify for participation in the 1200 compact. 1201 (c)âAll actions taken for the benefit of the commission or 1202 in furtherance of administration of the compact before the 1203 effective date of the compact or the commission coming into 1204 existence are considered to be actions of the commission unless 1205 specifically repudiated by the commission. 1206 (d)âAny state that joins the compact subsequent to the 1207 commissionâs initial adoption of the rules and bylaws is subject 1208 to the rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on which the 1209 compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been 1210 previously adopted by the commission has the full force and 1211 effect of law on the day the compact becomes law in that state. 1212 (3)âAny member state may withdraw from the compact by 1213 enacting a statute repealing the compact. 1214 (a)âA member stateâs withdrawal does not take effect until 1215 180 days after enactment of the repealing statute. 1216 (b)âWithdrawal does not affect the continuing requirement 1217 of the withdrawing stateâs licensing authority to comply with 1218 the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of 1219 the compact before the effective date of withdrawal. 1220 (c)âUpon enactment of a statute repealing the compact, a 1221 state shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all 1222 licensees within that state. Notwithstanding any subsequent 1223 statutory enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing state must 1224 continue to recognize all licenses granted under the compact for 1225 at least 180 days after the date of such notice of withdrawal. 1226 (4)âThe compact does not invalidate or prevent any 1227 licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a 1228 member state and a nonmember state which does not conflict with 1229 the compact. 1230 (5)âThe compact may be amended by the member states. An 1231 amendment to the compact does not become effective and binding 1232 on any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all 1233 member states. 1234 1235 ARTICLE XV 1236 CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY 1237 1238 (1)âThe compact and the commissionâs rulemaking authority 1239 shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes, 1240 implementation, and administration of the compact. Provisions of 1241 the compact expressly authorizing or requiring the adoption of 1242 rules may not be construed to limit the commissionâs rulemaking 1243 authority solely for those purposes. 1244 (2)âThe provisions of the compact are severable, and, if 1245 any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of the compact is 1246 held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the 1247 constitution of any member state, of a state seeking 1248 participation in the compact, or of the United States, or the 1249 applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or 1250 circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of 1251 competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of the 1252 compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, 1253 agency, person, or circumstance is not affected. 1254 (3)âNotwithstanding subsection (2), the commission may deny 1255 a stateâs participation in the compact, or may terminate a 1256 member stateâs participation in the compact in accordance with 1257 the requirements of subsection (2) of Article XIII, if it 1258 determines that a constitutional requirement of a member state 1259 is a material departure from the compact. Otherwise, if the 1260 compact is held to be contrary to the constitution of any member 1261 state, the compact remains in full force and effect as to the 1262 remaining member states and in full force and effect as to the 1263 member state affected as to all severable matters. 1264 1265 ARTICLE XVI 1266 CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE LAWS 1267 1268 (1)âA licensee providing services in a remote state under a 1269 multistate authorization to practice shall adhere to the laws 1270 and regulations, including applicable standards, of the remote 1271 state where the client is located at the time care is rendered. 1272 (2)âThe compact does not prevent or inhibit the enforcement 1273 of any other law of a member state which is not inconsistent 1274 with the compact. 1275 (3)âAny law, statute, regulation, or other legal 1276 requirement in a member state in conflict with the compact are 1277 superseded to the extent of the conflict. 1278 (4)âAll permissible agreements between the commission and 1279 the member states are binding in accordance with their terms. 1280 Section 2.âParagraph (b) of subsection (10) of section 1281 456.073, Florida Statutes, is amended to read: 1282 456.073âDisciplinary proceedings.âDisciplinary proceedings 1283 for each board shall be within the jurisdiction of the 1284 department. 1285 (10) 1286 (b)âThe department shall report any significant 1287 investigation information relating to a nurse holding a 1288 multistate license to the coordinated licensure information 1289 system pursuant to s. 464.0095; any investigative information 1290 relating to an audiologist or a speech-language pathologist 1291 holding a compact privilege under the Audiology and Speech 1292 Language Pathology Interstate Compact to the data system 1293 pursuant to s. 468.1335; any investigative information relating 1294 to a physical therapist or physical therapist assistant holding 1295 a compact privilege under the Physical Therapy Licensure Compact 1296 to the data system pursuant to s. 486.112; any significant 1297 investigatory information relating to a psychologist practicing 1298 under the Psychology Interjurisdictional Compact to the 1299 coordinated licensure information system pursuant to s. 1300 490.0075; and any significant investigatory information relating 1301 to a health care practitioner practicing under the Professional 1302 Counselors Licensure Compact to the data system pursuant to s. 1303 491.017; and any significant investigative information relating 1304 to a clinical social worker practicing under the Social Work 1305 Licensure Interstate Compact to the data system pursuant to s. 1306 491.022. 1307 Section 3.âSubsection (5) of section 456.076, Florida 1308 Statutes, is amended to read: 1309 456.076âImpaired practitioner programs.â 1310 (5)âA consultant shall enter into a participant contract 1311 with an impaired practitioner and shall establish the terms of 1312 monitoring and shall include the terms in a participant 1313 contract.

Subpoenas 578 issued by a licensing authority in a member state for the 579 attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of 580 evidence from another member state must be enforced in the 581 latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according 582 to the practice and procedure of that court applicable to 583 subpoenas issued in proceedings pending before it. The issuing 584 licensing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, 585 mileage, and other fees required by the service statutes of the 586 state in which the witnesses or evidence is located. 587 (b)âOnly the home state may take adverse action against a 588 regulated social workerâs multistate license. 589 (2)âFor purposes of taking adverse action, the home state 590 must give the same priority and effect to reported conduct 591 received from a member state as it would if the conduct had 592 occurred within the home state. In so doing, the home state 593 shall apply its own state laws to determine appropriate action. 594 (3)âThe home state shall complete any pending 595 investigations of a regulated social worker who changes his or 596 her home state during the course of the investigation.

The administrator of the data system shall 600 promptly notify the new home state of any adverse action. 601 (4)âA member state may, if otherwise authorized by state 602 law, recover from the affected regulated social worker the costs 603 of investigations and dispositions of cases resulting from any 604 adverse action taken against that regulated social worker. 605 (5)âA member state may take adverse action based on the 606 factual findings of another member state, provided that the 607 member state follows its own procedures for taking the adverse 608 action. 609 (6)(a)âIn addition to the authority granted to a member 610 state by its respective social work practice act or other 611 applicable state law, any member state may participate with 612 other member states in joint investigations of licensees. 613 (b)âMember states shall share any investigative, 614 litigation, or compliance materials in furtherance of any joint 615 or individual investigation initiated under the compact. 616 (7)âIf adverse action is taken by the home state against 617 the multistate license of a regulated social worker, the 618 regulated social workerâs multistate authorization to practice 619 in all other member states must be deactivated until all 620 encumbrances have been removed from the multistate license. All 621 home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse action 622 against the license of a regulated social worker must include a 623 statement that the regulated social workerâs multistate 624 authorization to practice is deactivated in all member states 625 until all conditions of the decision, order, or agreement are 626 satisfied. 627 (8)âIf a member state takes adverse action, it must 628 promptly notify the administrator of the data system. The 629 administrator of the data system shall promptly notify the home 630 state and all other member states of any adverse actions taken 631 by remote states. 632 (9)âThe compact does not override a member stateâs decision 633 that participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu 634 of adverse action. 635 (10)âThe compact does not authorize a member state to 636 demand the issuance of subpoenas for attendance and testimony of 637 witnesses or the production of evidence from another member 638 state for lawful actions within that member state. 639 (11)âThe compact does not authorize a member state to 640 impose discipline against a regulated social worker who holds a 641 multistate authorization to practice for actions committed in 642 another member state which were lawful in that state. 643 644 ARTICLE X 645 ESTABLISHMENT OF SOCIAL WORK LICENSURE COMPACT COMMISSION 646 647 (1)âThe compact member states hereby create and establish a 648 joint government agency whose membership consists of all member 649 states that have enacted the compact, to be known as the Social 650 Work Licensure Compact Commission.

A rule is invalid and has no force or 976 effect if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the rule 977 is invalid because the commission exercised its rulemaking 978 authority in a manner that is beyond the scope and purposes of 979 the compact, or the powers granted hereunder, or based upon 980 another applicable standard of review. 981 (2)âThe rules of the commission have the force of law in 982 each member state; however, if the rules of the commission 983 conflict with the laws, regulations, or applicable standards of 984 a member state governing the practice of social work as held by 985 a court of competent jurisdiction, the rules of the commission 986 are ineffective in that state to the extent of the conflict. 987 (3)âThe commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers 988 pursuant to the criteria set forth in this article and the rules 989 adopted hereunder. Rules become binding the day after they are 990 adopted or the date specified in the rule or amendment, 991 whichever is later. 992 (4)âIf a majority of the legislatures of the member states 993 rejects a rule or portion of a rule, by enactment of a statute 994 or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact 995 within 4 years after the date of adoption of the rule, such rule 996 has no further force and effect in any member state. 997 (5)âRules must be adopted at a regular or special meeting 998 of the commission. 999 (6)âBefore adoption of a proposed rule, the commission 1000 shall hold a public hearing and allow persons to provide oral 1001 and written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments. 1002 (7)âBefore adoption of a proposed rule by the commission, 1003 and at least 30 days before the meeting at which the commission 1004 will hold a public hearing on the proposed rule, the commission 1005 shall provide a notice of proposed rulemaking: 1006 (a)âOn the website of the commission or on another publicly 1007 accessible platform; 1008 (b)âTo persons who have requested notice of the 1009 commissionâs notices of proposed rulemaking; and 1010 (c)âIn any other manner as specified by commission rule. 1011 (8)âThe notice of proposed rulemaking must include all of 1012 the following: 1013 (a)âThe time, date, and location of the public hearing at 1014 which the commission will hear public comments on the proposed 1015 rule and, if different, the time, date, and location of the 1016 meeting where the commission will consider and vote on the 1017 proposed rule. 1018 (b)âIf the hearing is held through telecommunication, video 1019 conference, or other similar electronic means, the mechanism for 1020 accessing the hearing must be included in the notice of proposed 1021 rulemaking. 1022 (c)âThe text of the proposed rule and the reasons 1023 necessitating the rule. 1024 (d)âA request for comments on the proposed rule from any 1025 interested person. 1026 (e)âThe manner in which interested persons may submit 1027 written comments. 1028 (9)âAll hearings must be recorded. A copy of the recording 1029 and all written comments and documents received by the 1030 commission in response to the proposed rule must be made 1031 available to the public. 1032 (10)âThis article does not require a separate hearing on 1033 each rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the 1034 commission at hearings required by this article. 1035 (11)âThe commission shall, by majority vote of all members, 1036 take final action on the proposed rule based on the rulemaking 1037 record and the full text of the rule. 1038 (a)âThe commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule 1039 if the changes do not expand the original purpose of the 1040 proposed rule. 1041 (b)âThe commission shall provide an explanation of the 1042 reasons for substantive changes made to the proposed rule as 1043 well as the reasons why substantive changes recommended by 1044 commenters were not made. 1045 (c)âThe commission shall set a reasonable effective date 1046 for each rule. Except for an emergency as provided in subsection 1047 (12), the effective date of the rule must be at least 30 days 1048 after the commission issues the notice of rule adoption or 1049 amendment. 1050 (12)âUpon determination that an emergency exists, the 1051 commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule with 48 1052 hoursâ notice, with opportunity to comment, provided that the 1053 usual rulemaking procedures provided in the compact and in this 1054 article are retroactively applied to the rule as soon as 1055 reasonably possible, but in no event later than 90 days after 1056 the effective date of the rule. For purposes of this subsection, 1057 an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately in 1058 order to: 1059 (a)âMeet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or 1060 welfare; 1061 (b)âPrevent a loss of commission or member state funds; 1062 (c)âMeet a deadline for the adoption of a rule which is 1063 established by federal law or rule; or 1064 (d)âProtect public health and safety. 1065 (13)âThe commission or an authorized committee of the 1066 commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted rule for 1067 purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, 1068 errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of 1069 any revision must be posted on the commissionâs website. The 1070 revision is subject to challenge by any person for a period of 1071 30 days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on 1072 the grounds that the revision results in a material change to a 1073 rule. A challenge must be made in writing and delivered to the 1074 commission before the end of the notice period. If a challenge 1075 is not made, the revision will take effect without further 1076 action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take 1077 effect without the approval of the commission. 1078 (14)âA member stateâs rulemaking requirements do not apply 1079 under this compact. 1080 1081 ARTICLE XIII 1082 OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT 1083 1084 (1)(a)âThe executive and judicial branches of state 1085 government in each member state shall enforce the compact and 1086 take all actions necessary to implement the compact. 1087 (b)âExcept as otherwise provided in the compact, venue is 1088 proper and judicial proceedings by or against the commission 1089 shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent 1090 jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is 1091 located. The commission may waive venue and jurisdictional 1092 defenses to the extent that it adopts or consents to participate 1093 in alternative dispute resolution proceedings. This paragraph 1094 does not affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in 1095 any action against a licensee for professional malpractice, 1096 misconduct, or any such similar matter. 1097 (c)âThe commission is entitled to receive service of 1098 process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or 1099 interpretation of the compact and has standing to intervene in 1100 such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the 1101 commission service of process renders a judgment or an order 1102 void as to the commission, the compact, or adopted rules. 1103 (2)(a)âIf the commission determines that a member state has 1104 defaulted in the performance of its obligations or 1105 responsibilities under the compact or the adopted rules, the 1106 commission must provide written notice to the defaulting state. 1107 The notice of default must describe the default, the proposed 1108 means of curing the default, and any other action that the 1109 commission may take, and must offer training and specific 1110 technical assistance regarding the default. 1111 (b)âThe commission shall provide a copy of the notice of 1112 default to the other member states. 1113 (c)âIf a state in default fails to cure the default, the 1114 defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an 1115 affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the member 1116 states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred on 1117 that state by the compact may be terminated on the effective 1118 date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the 1119 offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during 1120 the period of default. 1121 (d)âTermination of membership in the compact may be imposed 1122 only after all other means of securing compliance have been 1123 exhausted. The commission shall give notice of intent to suspend 1124 or terminate to the Governor of the defaulting state, the 1125 majority and minority leaders of the defaulting stateâs 1126 legislature, the defaulting stateâs licensing authority, and the 1127 licensing authority of each member state. 1128 (e)âA state that has its membership terminated from the 1129 compact is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and 1130 liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, 1131 including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of 1132 termination. 1133 (f)âUpon the termination of a stateâs membership from the 1134 compact, that state shall immediately provide notice to all 1135 licensees within that state of such termination. The terminated 1136 state shall continue to recognize all licenses granted under the 1137 compact for at least 180 days after the date of the notice of 1138 termination. 1139 (g)âThe commission does not bear any costs related to a 1140 state that is found to be in default or that has been terminated 1141 from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the 1142 commission and the defaulting state. 1143 (h)âThe defaulting state may appeal the action of the 1144 commission by petitioning the United States District Court for 1145 the District of Columbia or the federal district where the 1146 commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall 1147 be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable 1148 attorney fees. 1149 (3)(a)âUpon request by a member state, the commission shall 1150 attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact which arise 1151 among member states and between member and nonmember states. 1152 (b)âThe commission shall adopt a rule providing for both 1153 mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes, as 1154 appropriate. 1155 (4)(a)âBy majority vote as provided by rule, the commission 1156 may initiate legal action against a member state in default in 1157 the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or 1158 the federal district where the commission has its principal 1159 offices to enforce compliance with the compact and its adopted 1160 rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and 1161 damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the 1162 prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, 1163 including reasonable attorney fees. The remedies herein are not 1164 the exclusive remedies of the commission. The commission may 1165 pursue any other remedies available under federal law or the 1166 defaulting member stateâs law. 1167 (b)âA member state may initiate legal action against the 1168 commission in the United States District Court for the District 1169 of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its 1170 principal offices to enforce compliance with the compact and its 1171 adopted rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive 1172 relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is 1173 necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of 1174 such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. 1175 (c)âOnly a member state may seek enforcement of the compact 1176 against the commission. 1177 1178 ARTICLE XIV 1179 EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT 1180 1181 (1)âThe compact becomes effective on the date the compact 1182 statute is enacted into law in the seventh member state. 1183 (2)(a)âOn or after the effective date of the compact, the 1184 commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of the 1185 first seven charter member states to determine whether the 1186 statute enacted by each such charter member state is materially 1187 different from the model compact language. 1188 1.âA charter member state whose enactment is found to be 1189 materially different from the model compact language is entitled 1190 to the default process set forth in Article XIII. 1191 2.âIf any member state is later found to be in default or 1192 is terminated or withdraws from the compact, the commission 1193 remains in existence and the compact remains in effect even if 1194 the number of member states is less than seven. 1195 (b)âMember states enacting the compact after the seven 1196 initial charter member states are subject to the process set 1197 forth in paragraph (3)(u) of Article X to determine whether 1198 their enactments are materially different from the model compact 1199 language and whether they qualify for participation in the 1200 compact. 1201 (c)âAll actions taken for the benefit of the commission or 1202 in furtherance of administration of the compact before the 1203 effective date of the compact or the commission coming into 1204 existence are considered to be actions of the commission unless 1205 specifically repudiated by the commission. 1206 (d)âAny state that joins the compact subsequent to the 1207 commissionâs initial adoption of the rules and bylaws is subject 1208 to the rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on which the 1209 compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been 1210 previously adopted by the commission has the full force and 1211 effect of law on the day the compact becomes law in that state. 1212 (3)âAny member state may withdraw from the compact by 1213 enacting a statute repealing the compact. 1214 (a)âA member stateâs withdrawal does not take effect until 1215 180 days after enactment of the repealing statute. 1216 (b)âWithdrawal does not affect the continuing requirement 1217 of the withdrawing stateâs licensing authority to comply with 1218 the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of 1219 the compact before the effective date of withdrawal. 1220 (c)âUpon enactment of a statute repealing the compact, a 1221 state shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all 1222 licensees within that state. Notwithstanding any subsequent 1223 statutory enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing state must 1224 continue to recognize all licenses granted under the compact for 1225 at least 180 days after the date of such notice of withdrawal. 1226 (4)âThe compact does not invalidate or prevent any 1227 licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a 1228 member state and a nonmember state which does not conflict with 1229 the compact. 1230 (5)âThe compact may be amended by the member states. An 1231 amendment to the compact does not become effective and binding 1232 on any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all 1233 member states. 1234 1235 ARTICLE XV 1236 CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY 1237 1238 (1)âThe compact and the commissionâs rulemaking authority 1239 shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes, 1240 implementation, and administration of the compact. Provisions of 1241 the compact expressly authorizing or requiring the adoption of 1242 rules may not be construed to limit the commissionâs rulemaking 1243 authority solely for those purposes. 1244 (2)âThe provisions of the compact are severable, and, if 1245 any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of the compact is 1246 held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the 1247 constitution of any member state, of a state seeking 1248 participation in the compact, or of the United States, or the 1249 applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or 1250 circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of 1251 competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of the 1252 compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, 1253 agency, person, or circumstance is not affected. 1254 (3)âNotwithstanding subsection (2), the commission may deny 1255 a stateâs participation in the compact, or may terminate a 1256 member stateâs participation in the compact in accordance with 1257 the requirements of subsection (2) of Article XIII, if it 1258 determines that a constitutional requirement of a member state 1259 is a material departure from the compact. Otherwise, if the 1260 compact is held to be contrary to the constitution of any member 1261 state, the compact remains in full force and effect as to the 1262 remaining member states and in full force and effect as to the 1263 member state affected as to all severable matters. 1264 1265 ARTICLE XVI 1266 CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE LAWS 1267 1268 (1)âA licensee providing services in a remote state under a 1269 multistate authorization to practice shall adhere to the laws 1270 and regulations, including applicable standards, of the remote 1271 state where the client is located at the time care is rendered. 1272 (2)âThe compact does not prevent or inhibit the enforcement 1273 of any other law of a member state which is not inconsistent 1274 with the compact. 1275 (3)âAny law, statute, regulation, or other legal 1276 requirement in a member state in conflict with the compact are 1277 superseded to the extent of the conflict. 1278 (4)âAll permissible agreements between the commission and 1279 the member states are binding in accordance with their terms. 1280 Section 2.âParagraph (b) of subsection (10) of section 1281 456.073, Florida Statutes, is amended to read: 1282 456.073âDisciplinary proceedings.âDisciplinary proceedings 1283 for each board shall be within the jurisdiction of the 1284 department. 1285 (10) 1286 (b)âThe department shall report any significant 1287 investigation information relating to a nurse holding a 1288 multistate license to the coordinated licensure information 1289 system pursuant to s. 464.0095; any investigative information 1290 relating to an audiologist or a speech-language pathologist 1291 holding a compact privilege under the Audiology and Speech 1292 Language Pathology Interstate Compact to the data system 1293 pursuant to s. 468.1335; any investigative information relating 1294 to a physical therapist or physical therapist assistant holding 1295 a compact privilege under the Physical Therapy Licensure Compact 1296 to the data system pursuant to s. 486.112; any significant 1297 investigatory information relating to a psychologist practicing 1298 under the Psychology Interjurisdictional Compact to the 1299 coordinated licensure information system pursuant to s. 1300 490.0075; and any significant investigatory information relating 1301 to a health care practitioner practicing under the Professional 1302 Counselors Licensure Compact to the data system pursuant to s. 1303 491.017; and any significant investigative information relating 1304 to a clinical social worker practicing under the Social Work 1305 Licensure Interstate Compact to the data system pursuant to s. 1306 491.022. 1307 Section 3.âSubsection (5) of section 456.076, Florida 1308 Statutes, is amended to read: 1309 456.076âImpaired practitioner programs.â 1310 (5)âA consultant shall enter into a participant contract 1311 with an impaired practitioner and shall establish the terms of 1312 monitoring and shall include the terms in a participant 1313 contract.
