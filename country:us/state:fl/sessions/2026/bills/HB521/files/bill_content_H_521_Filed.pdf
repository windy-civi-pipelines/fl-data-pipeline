451 until the person presents a receipt from the governmental entity
452 or the clerk of court that provided the data showing that the
453 fines outstanding have been paid. This subsection does not apply
454 to the owner of a leased vehicle if the vehicle is registered in
455 the name of the lessee of the vehicle. The tax collector and the
456 clerk of the court are each entitled to receive monthly, as
457 costs for implementing and administering this subsection, 10
458 percent of the civil penalties and fines recovered from such
459 persons. As used in this subsection, the term "civil penalties
460 and fines" does not include a wrecker operator's lien as
461 described in s. 713.78(13). If the tax collector has private tag
462 agents, such tag agents are entitled to receive a pro rata share
463 of the amount paid to the tax collector, based upon the
464 percentage of license plates and revalidation stickers issued by
465 the tag agent compared to the total issued within the county.
466 The authority of any private agent to issue license plates shall
467 be revoked, after notice and a hearing as provided in chapter
468 120, if he or she issues any license plate or revalidation
469 sticker contrary to the provisions of this subsection. This
470 section applies both to the annual renewal of a motor vehicle
471 registration and the replacement of the motor vehicle
472 registration or license plate, but does not apply to the
473 transfer of a registration of a motor vehicle sold by a motor
474 vehicle dealer licensed under this chapter, except for the
475 transfer of registrations which includes the annual renewals.
