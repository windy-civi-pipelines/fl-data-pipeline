53 recording, or a portion thereof, must be disclosed by a local

76 obtain evidence to determine legal issues in a case in which the
77 person is a party;
78 (IV) Disclosure would reveal information regarding a
79 person which is of a highly sensitive personal nature;
80 (V) Disclosure may harm the reputation or jeopardize the
81 safety of a person depicted in the recording;
82 (VI) Confidentiality is necessary to prevent a serious and
83 imminent threat to the fair, impartial, and orderly
84 administration of justice;
85 (VII) The recording could be redacted to protect privacy
86 interests; and
87 (VIII) There is good cause to disclose all or portions of

92 to participate.

94 recording for at least 90 days.

102 (h) This subsection is subject to the Open Government
103 Sunset Review Act in accordance with s. 119.15 and shall stand
104 repealed on October 2, 2031, unless reviewed and saved from
105 repeal through reenactment by the Legislature.
106 Section 2. (1) The Legislature finds that it is a public
107 necessity that the following types of body camera recordings
108 recorded by a code inspector in the course of performing his or
109 her official duties and responsibilities be made confidential
110 and exempt from s. 119.07(1), Florida Statutes, and s. 24(a),
111 Article I of the State Constitution:
112 (a) Recordings taken within the interior of a private
113 residence.
114 (b) Recordings taken within the interior of a facility
115 that offers health care, mental health care, or social services.
116 (c) Recordings taken in a place that a reasonable person
117 would expect to be private.
118 (2) The Legislature recognizes that body cameras preserve
119 information that has the potential to assist both code
120 inspectors' and the public's ability to review the accuracy of
121 code inspection work.
122 (3) However, the Legislature also finds that, in certain
123 instances, audio and video recorded by body cameras is
124 significantly likely to capture highly sensitive personal
125 information. The exemption of body camera recordings from public

126 records requirements allows code inspectors to more effectively
127 and efficiently administer their duties, which would otherwise
128 be significantly impaired. The Legislature finds that the
129 concerns regarding the impact of public records requirements for
130 body camera recordings necessitate the exemption of the
131 recordings from public records requirements and outweigh any
132 public benefit that may be derived from such disclosure.
133 Section 3. This act shall take effect on the same date
134 that HB 539 or similar legislation takes effect, if such
135 legislation is adopted in the same legislative session or an
136 extension thereof and becomes a law.
