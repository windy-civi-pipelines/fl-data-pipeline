605 statement that the regulated social worker's multistate
606 authorization to practice is deactivated in all member states
607 until all conditions of the decision, order, or agreement are
608 satisfied.
609 (8) If a member state takes adverse action, it shall
610 promptly notify the administrator of the data system. The
611 administrator of the data system shall promptly notify the home
612 state and all other member states of any adverse actions by

615 decision that participation in an alternative program may be
616 used in lieu of adverse action.
617 (10) This compact does not authorize a member state to
618 demand the issuance of subpoenas for attendance and testimony of
619 witnesses or the production of evidence from another member
620 state for lawful actions within that member state.

1089 (c) The commission shall be entitled to receive service of
1090 process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or

1109 states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred on
1110 that state by this compact may be terminated on the effective
1111 date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the
1112 offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during

1136 commission by petitioning the United States District Court for
1137 the District of Columbia or the federal district where the
1138 commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall
1139 be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable

604 against the license of a regulated social worker shall include a
605 statement that the regulated social worker's multistate
606 authorization to practice is deactivated in all member states
607 until all conditions of the decision, order, or agreement are
608 satisfied.
609 (8) If a member state takes adverse action, it shall
610 promptly notify the administrator of the data system. The
611 administrator of the data system shall promptly notify the home
612 state and all other member states of any adverse actions by

615 decision that participation in an alternative program may be
616 used in lieu of adverse action.
617 (10) This compact does not authorize a member state to
618 demand the issuance of subpoenas for attendance and testimony of
619 witnesses or the production of evidence from another member
620 state for lawful actions within that member state.

1109 states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred on
1110 that state by this compact may be terminated on the effective
1111 date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the
1112 offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during

1136 commission by petitioning the United States District Court for
1137 the District of Columbia or the federal district where the
