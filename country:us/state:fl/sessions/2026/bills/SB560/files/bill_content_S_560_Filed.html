  109  child-caring agencies, and child-placing agencies; public
  110  records exemption.â
  111         (2)âAs used in this section, the term:
  112         (j)ââPersonnelâ means all owners, operators, employees, and
  113  volunteers working in a child-placing agency or residential
  114  child-caring agency who may be employed by or do volunteer work
  115  for a person, corporation, or agency that holds a license as a
  116  child-placing agency or a residential child-caring agency, but
  117  the term does not include those who do not work on the premises
  118  where child care is furnished and have no direct contact with a
  119  child or have no contact with a child outside of the presence of
  120  the childâs parent or guardian. For purposes of screening, the
  121  term includes any member, over the age of 12 years, of the
  122  family of the owner or operator or any person other than a
  123  client, <u class="Insert">a </u><u class="Insert">child who is found to be dependent as defined in s.</u>
  124  <u class="Insert">39.01, or a child as defined in s. 39.6251(1),</u> over the age of
  125  12 years, residing with the owner or operator if the agency is
  126  located in or adjacent to the home of the owner or operator or
  127  if the family member of, or person residing with, the owner or
  128  operator has any direct contact with the children. Members of
  129  the family of the owner or operator, or persons residing with
  130  the owner or operator, who are between the ages of 12 years and
  131  18 years are not required to be fingerprinted, but must be
  132  screened for delinquency records. For purposes of screening, the
  133  term also includes owners, operators, employees, and volunteers
  134  working in summer day camps, or summer 24-hour camps providing
  135  care for children. A volunteer who assists on an intermittent
  136  basis for less than 10 hours per month shall not be included in
  137  the term âpersonnelâ for the purposes of screening if a person
  138  who meets the screening requirement of this section is always
  139  present and has the volunteer in his or her line of sight.
  140         (k)ââPlacement screeningâ means the act of assessing the
  141  background of household members in the family foster home and
  142  includes, but is not limited to, criminal history records checks
  143  as provided in s. 39.0138 using the standards for screening set
  144  forth in that section. The term âhousehold memberâ means a
  145  member of the family or a person, other than the child being
  146  placed, <u class="Insert">a child who is found to be dependent as defined in s.</u>
  147  <u class="Insert">39.01, or a child as defined in s. 39.6251(1),</u> over the age of
  148  12 years who resides with the owner who operates the family
  149  foster home if such family member or person has any direct
  150  contact with the child. Household members who are between the
  151  ages of 12 and 18 years are not required to be fingerprinted but
  152  must be screened for delinquency records.
  153         Section 3.âSubsection (13) of section 409.912, Florida
  154  Statutes, is amended to read:
  155         409.912âCost-effective purchasing of health care.âThe
  156  agency shall purchase goods and services for Medicaid recipients
  157  in the most cost-effective manner consistent with the delivery
  158  of quality medical care. To ensure that medical services are
  159  effectively utilized, the agency may, in any case, require a
  160  confirmation or second physicianâs opinion of the correct
  161  diagnosis for purposes of authorizing future services under the
  162  Medicaid program. This section does not restrict access to
  163  emergency services or poststabilization care services as defined
  164  in 42 C.F.R. s. 438.114. Such confirmation or second opinion
  165  shall be rendered in a manner approved by the agency. The agency
  166  shall maximize the use of prepaid per capita and prepaid
  167  aggregate fixed-sum basis services when appropriate and other
  168  alternative service delivery and reimbursement methodologies,
  169  including competitive bidding pursuant to s. 287.057, designed
  170  to facilitate the cost-effective purchase of a case-managed
  171  continuum of care. The agency shall also require providers to
  172  minimize the exposure of recipients to the need for acute
  173  inpatient, custodial, and other institutional care and the
  174  inappropriate or unnecessary use of high-cost services. The
  175  agency shall contract with a vendor to monitor and evaluate the
  176  clinical practice patterns of providers in order to identify
  177  trends that are outside the normal practice patterns of a
  178  providerâs professional peers or the national guidelines of a
  179  providerâs professional association. The vendor must be able to
  180  provide information and counseling to a provider whose practice
  181  patterns are outside the norms, in consultation with the agency,
  182  to improve patient care and reduce inappropriate utilization.
  183  The agency may mandate prior authorization, drug therapy
  184  management, or disease management participation for certain
  185  populations of Medicaid beneficiaries, certain drug classes, or
  186  particular drugs to prevent fraud, abuse, overuse, and possible
  187  dangerous drug interactions. The Pharmaceutical and Therapeutics
  188  Committee shall make recommendations to the agency on drugs for
  189  which prior authorization is required. The agency shall inform
  190  the Pharmaceutical and Therapeutics Committee of its decisions
  191  regarding drugs subject to prior authorization. The agency is
  192  authorized to limit the entities it contracts with or enrolls as
  193  Medicaid providers by developing a provider network through
  194  provider credentialing. The agency may competitively bid single
  195  source-provider contracts if procurement of goods or services
  196  results in demonstrated cost savings to the state without
  197  limiting access to care. The agency may limit its network based
  198  on the assessment of beneficiary access to care, provider
  199  availability, provider quality standards, time and distance
  200  standards for access to care, the cultural competence of the
  201  provider network, demographic characteristics of Medicaid
  202  beneficiaries, practice and provider-to-beneficiary standards,
  203  appointment wait times, beneficiary use of services, provider
  204  turnover, provider profiling, provider licensure history,
  205  previous program integrity investigations and findings, peer
  206  review, provider Medicaid policy and billing compliance records,
  207  clinical and medical record audits, and other factors. Providers
  208  are not entitled to enrollment in the Medicaid provider network.
  209  The agency shall determine instances in which allowing Medicaid
  210  beneficiaries to purchase durable medical equipment and other
  211  goods is less expensive to the Medicaid program than long-term
  212  rental of the equipment or goods. The agency may establish rules
  213  to facilitate purchases in lieu of long-term rentals in order to
  214  protect against fraud and abuse in the Medicaid program as
  215  defined in s. 409.913. The agency may seek federal waivers
  216  necessary to administer these policies.
  217         (13)âThe agency may not pay for psychotropic medication
  218  prescribed for a child in the Medicaid program without the
  219  express and informed consent of the childâs parent or legal
  220  guardian. The physician shall document the consent in the
  221  childâs medical record and provide <u class="Insert">a copy of such documentation</u>
  222  <u class="Insert">to</u> the pharmacy <s class="Remove">with a signed attestation of this documentation</s>
  223  with the prescription. The express and informed consent or court
  224  authorization for a prescription of psychotropic medication for
  225  a child in the custody of the Department of Children and
  226  Families shall be obtained pursuant to s. 39.407.
  227         Section 4.âThis act shall take effect July 1, 2026.
