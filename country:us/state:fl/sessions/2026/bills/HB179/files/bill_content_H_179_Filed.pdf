486 Section 2. Paragraph (c) of subsection (1) of section
487 744.21031, Florida Statutes, is amended to read:
488 744.21031 Public records exemption.—
489 (1) For purposes of this section, the term:
490 (c) "Telephone numbers" has the same meaning as provided
491 in s. 119.071(4)(d)1.d. s. 119.071(4)(d)1.c.
492 Section 3. The Legislature finds that it is a public
493 necessity that the home addresses, dates of birth, and telephone
494 numbers of current appellate court clerks; the names, home
495 addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, and places of
496 employment of the spouses and children of current appellate
497 court clerks; and the names and locations of schools and day
498 care facilities attended by children of current appellate court
499 clerks be made exempt from s. 119.07(1), Florida Statutes, and

502 answer telephone calls, respond to correspondence, and interact
503 with visitors to the courthouse, appellate court clerks may
504 incur the ill will of litigants and their associates and
505 families. As a result, current appellate court clerks and their
506 spouses and children may be targets for acts of revenge. If such
507 identifying and location information is released, the safety of
508 current appellate court clerks and their spouses and children
509 could be seriously jeopardized. For this reason, the Legislature
510 finds that it is a public necessity that such information be
511 made exempt from public records requirements.
