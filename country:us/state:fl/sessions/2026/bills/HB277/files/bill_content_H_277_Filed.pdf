102 Section 1. This act may be cited as the "Domestic
103 Emergency and Batterers Reform and Accountability Act."
104 Section 2. Subsection (6) of section 365.171, Florida
105 Statutes, is amended, and paragraph (e) is added to subsection
106 (4) of that section, to read:
107 365.171 Emergency communications state plan.—
108 (4) STATE PLAN.—The office shall develop, maintain, and
109 implement appropriate modifications for a statewide emergency
110 communications plan. The plan shall provide for:
111 (e) A system or process to flag addresses at which a "911"
112 call was placed to local emergency services to report that an
113 incident of domestic violence or dating violence has occurred.
114 Such system must correspond between all emergency services,
115 including, but not limited to, law enforcement, firefighting,
116 emergency medical services, poison control, suicide prevention,
117 and emergency management services. An address must remain
118 flagged in the system for at least 1 year after the "911" call
119 was placed that initiated the flag. The 1-year time period
120 resets after each call relating to an allegation of an incident
121 of domestic violence or dating violence at the same address.
122
123 The office shall be responsible for the implementation and
124 coordination of such plan. The office shall adopt any necessary
125 rules and schedules related to public agencies for implementing

126 and coordinating the plan, pursuant to chapter 120.
127 (6) REGIONAL SYSTEMS.—This section does not prohibit or
128 discourage the formation of multijurisdictional or regional
129 systems; and any system established pursuant to this section may
130 include the jurisdiction, or any portion thereof, of more than
131 one public agency. It is the intent of the Legislature that
132 emergency communications services be available throughout the
133 state. Expenditure by counties of the fee authorized and imposed
134 under s. 365.172 should support this intent to the greatest
135 extent feasible within the context of local service needs and
136 fiscal capability. Each county shall integrate the system or
137 process created in paragraph (4)(e) based on the county's
138 resources and availability. This section does not prohibit two
139 or more counties from establishing a combined emergency
140 communications service by an interlocal agreement and using the
141 fees authorized and imposed by s. 365.172 for such combined
142 service.
143 Section 3. Subsections (4), (5), and (11) of section
144 401.27, Florida Statutes, are amended, and paragraph (c) is
145 added to subsection (2) of that section, to read:
