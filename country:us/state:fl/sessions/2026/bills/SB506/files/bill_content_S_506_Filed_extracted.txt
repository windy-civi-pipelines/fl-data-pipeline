The exemption of body camera recordings from public 125 records requirements allows code inspectors to administer their 126 duties more effectively and efficiently, which would otherwise 127 be significantly impaired. The Legislature finds that the 128 concerns regarding the impact of public records requirements for 129 body camera recordings necessitate the exemption of the 130 recordings from public records requirements and outweigh any 131 public benefit that may be derived from their disclosure. 132 Section 3.âBy October 1, 2026, the Division of Library and 133 Information Services of the Department of State shall by rule 134 incorporate into the appropriate general records schedule a 90 135 day retention requirement for body camera recordings recorded by 136 code inspectors. 137 Section 4.âThis act shall take effect on the same date that 138 SB 504 or similar legislation takes effect, if such legislation 139 is adopted in the same legislative session or an extension 140 thereof and becomes a law.
