The release of such 79 information before the respondent has been personally served 80 with a copy of the petition, affidavits, notice of hearing, or 81 temporary injunction could significantly threaten the physical 82 safety and security of persons seeking protection through 83 injunctive proceedings and their families, and of law 84 enforcement tasked with serving the petition for injunction, 85 affidavits, notice of hearing, or temporary injunction on the 86 respondent. The harm that may result from the release of the 87 information outweighs any public benefit that might result from 88 public disclosure of the information. 89 Section 3.âThis act shall take effect on the same date that 90 SB 32 or similar legislation takes effect, if such legislation 91 is adopted in the same legislative session or an extension 92 thereof and becomes a law.
