   47         3.âAny information that can be used to identify a
   48  petitioner or respondent in a petition for an injunction against
   49  domestic violence, repeat violence, dating violence, sexual
   50  violence, <u class="Insert">serious violence by a known person,</u> stalking, or

   56  temporary injunction.
   57         Section 2.â<u class="Insert">(1)</u><u class="Insert">â</u><u class="Insert">The Legislature finds that it is a public</u>
   58  <u class="Insert">necessity that </u><u class="Insert">a petition, and the contents thereof, for an</u>

   65  <u class="Insert">s. 24(a), Article I of the State Constitution. The Legislature</u>
   66  <u class="Insert">finds that the existence of, and the unverified allegations</u>
   67  <u class="Insert">contained in, such a petition may be defamatory to an individual</u>
   68  <u class="Insert">named in it and cause unwarranted damage to the reputation of</u>
   69  <u class="Insert">such individual. The Legislature further finds that removing</u>
   70  <u class="Insert">such a record from public disclosure is the sole means of</u>
   71  <u class="Insert">protecting the reputation of such an individual.</u>
   72         <u class="Insert">(2)</u><u class="Insert">â</u><u class="Insert">Additionally, the Legislature finds that it is a public</u>
   73  <u class="Insert">necessity that any information that can be used to identify a</u>
   74  <u class="Insert">petitioner or respondent in a petition for an injunction against</u>
   75  <u class="Insert">serious violence by a known person, and </u><u class="Insert">any </u><u class="Insert">affidavits, notice</u>
   76  <u class="Insert">of hearing, and temporary injunction, be made confidential and</u>
   77  <u class="Insert">exempt from s. 119.07(1), Florida Statutes, and s. 24(a),</u>
   78  <u class="Insert">Article I of the State Constitution. </u><u class="Insert">The r</u><u class="Insert">elease of such</u>

   80  <u class="Insert">with a copy of the petition, affidavits, notice of hearing, </u><u class="Insert">or</u>
   81  <u class="Insert">temporary injunction could significantly threaten the physical</u>
   82  <u class="Insert">safety and security of persons seeking protection through</u>
   83  <u class="Insert">injunctive proceedings and their families, and of law</u>

   89         Section 3.âThis act shall take effect on the same date that
   90  SB 32 or similar legislation takes effect, if such legislation
   91  is adopted in the same legislative session or an extension
   92  thereof and becomes a law.
