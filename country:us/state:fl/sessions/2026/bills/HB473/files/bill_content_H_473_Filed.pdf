76 terrorist groups because of their access to such information.
77 The Legislature finds that allowing continued public access to
78 the identification and location information of such current and

82 that protecting the safety and security of such current and
83 former civilian contractors and government employees, and their
84 spouses and dependents, outweighs any public benefit that may be
85 derived from the public disclosure of the identification and
86 location information.
87 Section 3. This act shall take effect July 1, 2026.
