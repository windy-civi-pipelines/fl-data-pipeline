  493         Section 2.â<u class="Insert">The Legislature finds that it is a public</u>
  494  <u class="Insert">necessity that the home addresses, telephone numbers, dates of</u>

  509  <u class="Insert">after review and investigation of such complaints, does not</u>
  510  <u class="Insert">discipline a judge or does not take the complainantâs preferred</u>
  511  <u class="Insert">course of action against a judge, dissatisfied litigants</u>
  512  <u class="Insert">sometimes turn their ire toward commission employees as part of</u>
  513  <u class="Insert">their campaign against the actions of the judge in the</u>
  514  <u class="Insert">underlying litigation. Employees of the commission have been</u>
  515  <u class="Insert">subject to acts of intimidation by such dissatisfied litigants,</u>
  516  <u class="Insert">including online doxing of staff members, posting of false and</u>
  517  <u class="Insert">defamatory statements concerning employees on social media,</u>
  518  <u class="Insert">threatening e-mails and telephone calls, and inappropriate</u>
  519  <u class="Insert">contact regarding commission affairs at the personal residences</u>
  520  <u class="Insert">of employees and employeesâ family members. These acts of</u>
  521  <u class="Insert">intimidation have left commission employees in fear of harm by</u>
  522  <u class="Insert">disgruntled litigants who seek punishment of judges by the</u>
  523  <u class="Insert">commission for unfavorable litigation results. The Legislature</u>
  524  <u class="Insert">finds that the release of personal identifying and location</u>
  525  <u class="Insert">information of current or former employees of the Judicial</u>
  526  <u class="Insert">Qualifications Commission and their family members may place</u>

  530         Section 3.âThis act shall take effect July 1, 2026.
