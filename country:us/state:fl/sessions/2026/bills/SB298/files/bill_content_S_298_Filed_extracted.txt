Additionally, the 66 Legislature finds that it is a public necessity that information 67 that reveals the identity of a victim of domestic violence or 68 dating violence or the identity of persons responsible for the 69 welfare of such victim be made confidential and exempt from 70 public records requirements because the disclosure of such 71 sensitive personal identifying information could impede the open 72 communication and coordination among the parties involved in the 73 coordinating council or a county-level council. The harm that 74 would result from the release of such information substantially 75 outweighs any public benefit that would be achieved by 76 disclosure. 77 (2)âThe Legislature further finds that it is a public 78 necessity that portions of meetings of the coordinating council 79 or a county-level council during which exempt or confidential 80 and exempt information, information protected under chapter 741, 81 Florida Statutes, the identity of the victim, or the identity of 82 persons responsible for the welfare of the victim is discussed 83 be made exempt from s. 286.011, Florida Statutes, and s. 24(b), 84 Article I of the State Constitution. Failure to close the 85 portions of the meetings in which such sensitive personal 86 identifying information is discussed would defeat the purpose of 87 the public records exemption. Further, the Legislature finds 88 that the exemption is narrowly tailored to apply only to those 89 portions of the meetings in which such sensitive personal 90 identifying information is discussed and that the remainder of 91 such meetings remain open to allow for public oversight. 92 Section 3.âThis act shall take effect on the same date that 93 SB 296 or similar legislation takes effect, if such legislation 94 is adopted in the same legislative session or an extension 95 thereof and becomes a law.
