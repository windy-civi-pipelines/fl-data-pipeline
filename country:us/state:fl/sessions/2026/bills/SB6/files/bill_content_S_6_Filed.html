       38-00037-26                                              20266__
    1                        A bill to be entitled                      
    2         An act for the relief of L.E. by the Department of
    3         Children and Families; providing an appropriation to
    4         compensate L.E. for injuries and damages sustained as
    5         a result of the negligence of the department;
    6         providing a limitation on compensation and the payment
    7         of attorney fees; providing an effective date.
    8  
    9         WHEREAS, L.E. was born on July 29, 2019, and, at birth,
   10  tested positive for amphetamines, and
   11         WHEREAS, L.E.âs biological mother tested positive for
   12  amphetamines after the delivery of L.E., and
   13         WHEREAS, while at the hospital, L.E.âs biological mother
   14  and father engaged in a violent altercation with each other, and
   15         WHEREAS, shortly after L.E.âs birth, the Department of
   16  Children and Families received two child abuse hotline reports,
   17  one alleging intrafamily violence threatening L.E. and the other
   18  alleging drug exposure of newborn L.E., and
   19         WHEREAS, under s. 39.001, Florida Statutes, the department
   20  is charged with the duty of conducting child protective
   21  investigations to ensure child safety and prevent further harm
   22  to children and owed L.E. a duty to ensure her safety and
   23  prevent further harm, and
   24         WHEREAS, the department sent a child protective
   25  investigator to the hospital to initiate an investigation of the
   26  reported abuse, and
   27         WHEREAS, the department discovered that L.E.âs mother had a
   28  history of substance abuse, untreated mental health issues, and
   29  a criminal history involving violence, and
   30         WHEREAS, the department discovered that both L.E.âs mother
   31  and father had an extensive history of involvement with the
   32  department, including, collectively, at least 20 prior child
   33  abuse hotline reports, and
   34         WHEREAS, one of those prior reports involved egregious
   35  abuse of L.E.âs biological fatherâs other daughter when she was
   36  not yet 6 months old, resulting in long-bone fractures, and
   37         WHEREAS, the department removed that daughter from the
   38  fatherâs care, and
   39         WHEREAS, L.E.âs motherâs other two biological children had
   40  previously been removed from her care due to verified child
   41  abuse, and
   42         WHEREAS, as L.E.âs mother placed her third child for
   43  adoption, she was also planning to place L.E. for adoption and
   44  made such arrangements before L.E.âs birth, and
   45         WHEREAS, shortly after L.E. was born, L.E.âs mother
   46  abandoned L.E. at the hospital and, against medical advice, left
   47  the hospital with L.E.âs father, and
   48         WHEREAS, an adoption specialist arrived at the hospital to
   49  visit L.E., and
   50         WHEREAS, while L.E. was still in the hospital following her
   51  birth, the department determined that L.E. was in âpresent
   52  dangerâ if left in the care of her parents and that immediate
   53  action was necessary to protect L.E. from further abuse or
   54  neglect, and
   55         WHEREAS, the department contracted with a child welfare
   56  agency and, instead of removing L.E. from her parentsâ care
   57  through a judicial process, the department and its subcontractor
   58  developed an out-of-home safety plan to place L.E. with a friend
   59  of L.E.âs mother, and
   60         WHEREAS, within 3 weeks after that placement, the friend
   61  realized that she could no longer care for L.E. and informed the
   62  department of this, and
   63         WHEREAS, despite a reassessment that established that there
   64  was still a âpresent dangerâ to L.E. if left in the care of her
   65  parents, the department relied upon information from its
   66  subcontracted agency, and the joint decision was made to place
   67  L.E. into her parentsâ care, and
   68         WHEREAS, on August 21, 2019, L.E. was placed into her
   69  parentsâ home, and
   70         WHEREAS, on or about September 17, 2019, less than 4 weeks
   71  later, the department determined that it would be closing its
   72  investigation, despite acknowledging that L.E.âs home situation
   73  was volatile and unstable and that L.E.âs mother remained
   74  violent and impulsive, and
   75         WHEREAS, the subcontractor planned to decrease its
   76  monitoring of L.E. and the home upon the department closing its
   77  investigation, and
   78         WHEREAS, on September 18, 2019, the subcontractor
   79  transitioned its services from safety management to nonjudicial
   80  in-home services, which inherently decreased monitoring of L.E.
   81  by child welfare professionals, and
   82         WHEREAS, on September 24, 2019, the department closed its
   83  investigation, despite having no evidence of change or progress
   84  with L.E.âs parents, and
   85         WHEREAS, despite the subcontractorâs claims that it had
   86  provided services to the parents, the department expressly
   87  acknowledged in its own investigative summary that, at the time
   88  of closing its case, â[t]he home environment continues to be
   89  volatile and unstable on a normal basis. The fighting in the
   90  home will stabilize for a period of time but will always return
   91  to a chaotic and aggressive environment... [violent and
   92  impulsive behaviors] are clearly evident and severe... there
   93  [have] been no clear changes made to their behaviors and the
   94  patterns continue... [and] all of the children [including L.E.]
   95  are vulnerable,â and
   96         WHEREAS, the very next day, on September 25, 2019, L.E. was
   97  brought to Rockledge Regional Hospital in distress and
   98  experiencing seizures, and
   99         WHEREAS, medical staff at Rockledge Regional Hospital found
  100  makeup covering obvious bruising across her forehead, and
  101         WHEREAS, doctors determined that L.E. had suffered
  102  catastrophic injuries from child abuse which had occurred over a
  103  period of time, including a parietal calvarial skull fracture; a
  104  left frontal parietal subdural hematoma with bilateral frontal,
  105  temporal, and parietal cortical edema and encephalomalacia;
  106  healing fractures of the left sixth and seventh ribs; a healing
  107  fracture of the right eighth rib; acute fractures to the right
  108  tenth and eleventh ribs; a pelvic fractureâleft acetabular
  109  cortical avulsion fracture; cortical buckling of the right
  110  proximal tibial medial metaphysis; and multiple ecchymotic
  111  lesions to the forehead, and
  112         WHEREAS, L.E. was immediately transferred to Nemours
  113  Childrenâs Hospital in Orlando and admitted in critical
  114  condition, due to severe organ system injury and dysfunction,
  115  and was diagnosed as being at risk for hypoxia, hypercarbia,
  116  hypotension, sepsis, shock, cardiorespiratory arrest,
  117  intracranial hypertension, cerebral edema, stroke, and death,
  118  and
  119         WHEREAS, L.E. was diagnosed with shaken baby syndrome
  120  causing traumatic brain injury, seizures, and cerebral palsy, as
  121  well as malnourishment, and
  122         WHEREAS, between August 21, 2019, and September 25, 2019,
  123  L.E. was subjected to repeated and severe child abuse and
  124  neglect while in the care of her parents, and
  125         WHEREAS, L.E.âs parents were arrested, charged, and
  126  convicted of aggravated child abuse, based upon their abuse of
  127  L.E. while she was in their home between August 21, 2019, and
  128  September 25, 2019, and
  129         WHEREAS, L.E. was subsequently adopted by her maternal
  130  grandmother and relocated to Chicago, where she is followed by a
  131  medical team at Lurie Childrenâs Hospital, and
  132         WHEREAS, L.E. has received, and will continue to receive,
  133  therapeutic services across a host of disciplines, including
  134  occupational, physical, speech, nutritional, vision, and
  135  cognitive therapy, and
  136         WHEREAS, L.E., who just turned 6 years old, is currently
  137  under an individual educational plan at school for her
  138  disability, which has been formally classified as traumatic
  139  brain injury, and
  140         WHEREAS, L.E. requires and will continue to require
  141  constant care, monitoring, supervision, various therapies,
  142  multiple specialist services, and supportive care throughout the
  143  remainder of her life, which may include admission to a skilled
  144  residential home if her adoptive parent is no longer able to
  145  care for her, and
  146         WHEREAS, the department, charged with the responsibility
  147  for operating Floridaâs child welfare system, failed in its
  148  duties to ensure L.E.âs safety and protect her from harm, and
  149         WHEREAS, the departmentâs negligence, in combination with
  150  the failures of its subcontracted agency, resulted in
  151  catastrophic brain injury that will have a significant impact on
  152  L.E. for the remainder of her life, and
  153         WHEREAS, the department agreed to resolve L.E.âs claims
  154  against the department through a negotiated settlement in the
  155  Circuit Court for the 18th Judicial Circuit in and for Brevard
  156  County, under case number 05-2022-CA-033685, in the total amount
  157  of $4 million, and
  158         WHEREAS, the settlement agreement required that the
  159  department make an initial payment of $200,000, which is the
  160  maximum amount allowed under the sovereign immunity limitations
  161  imposed under s. 768.28, Florida Statutes; and that the
  162  remaining $3.8 million be paid contingent upon the passage and
  163  funding of this claim bill, which the department has expressly
  164  agreed it does not and will not oppose, and
  165         WHEREAS, on July 9, 2024, the settlement agreement was
  166  approved by the circuit court, and, with the departmentâs
  167  agreement and consent, a final judgment was entered against the
  168  department in the amount of $4 million pursuant to the
  169  negotiated settlement, and
  170         WHEREAS, L.E.âs civil claims against the subcontracted
  171  child welfare agency remain pending, NOW, THEREFORE,
