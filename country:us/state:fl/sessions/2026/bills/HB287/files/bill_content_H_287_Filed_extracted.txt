HB 287 2026
501 Section 2. (1) The Legislature finds that it is a public
502 necessity that the home addresses, telephone numbers, places of
503 employment, dates of birth, and photographs of former and
504 current owners and operators, and their spouses and children, of
505 family foster homes licensed by the Department of Children and
506 Families, and the names and locations of schools and day care
507 facilities attended by the children of such persons be made
508 exempt from s. 119.07(1), Florida Statutes, and s. 24(a),
509 Article 1 of the State Constitution. Such identifying and
510 location information can be used to locate children placed in a
511 family foster home by the Department of Children and Families,
512 the owner or operator of such home, and the other children
513 living at the home to threaten or harm the children, owner, or
514 operator; to perpetuate fraud against any of these individuals;
515 or to acquire sensitive personal, financial, medical, and
516 familial information, the release of which could cause great
517 financial harm to the individual.
518 (2) Children placed in a family foster home are often
519 removed from the care of their biological parents due to
520 physical, sexual, and emotional abuse; domestic violence; drug
521 use; neglect; and many other reasons for which the state has
522 identified the children are in danger. As such, it is necessary
523 to protect the location of such children from being known by
524 their biological parents until the case has been litigated and
525 the children have been returned to their biological parents upon

526 satisfactory completion of their case plan and having their
527 parenting rights restored. As a result of being the person
528 ultimately responsible for the care of a child who is removed
529 from the home of his or her biological parents, owners and
530 operators of family foster homes may incur the ill will of the
531 biological parents, thus making such owners and operators and
532 their other children targets for acts of revenge. If such
533 identifying and location information is released, the safety of
534 the owners and operators of family foster homes and all children
535 living with them could be seriously jeopardized. The Legislature
536 further finds that the harm that may result from the release of
537 such personal identifying and location information outweighs any
538 public benefit that may be derived from the disclosure of the
539 information.
540 Section 3. This act shall take effect July 1, 2026.

HB 287 2026
501 Section 2. (1) The Legislature finds that it is a public
502 necessity that the home addresses, telephone numbers, places of
503 employment, dates of birth, and photographs of former and
504 current owners and operators, and their spouses and children, of
505 family foster homes licensed by the Department of Children and
506 Families, and the names and locations of schools and day care
507 facilities attended by the children of such persons be made
508 exempt from s. 119.07(1), Florida Statutes, and s. 24(a),
509 Article 1 of the State Constitution. Such identifying and
510 location information can be used to locate children placed in a
511 family foster home by the Department of Children and Families,
512 the owner or operator of such home, and the other children
513 living at the home to threaten or harm the children, owner, or
514 operator; to perpetuate fraud against any of these individuals;
515 or to acquire sensitive personal, financial, medical, and
516 familial information, the release of which could cause great
517 financial harm to the individual.
518 (2) Children placed in a family foster home are often
519 removed from the care of their biological parents due to
520 physical, sexual, and emotional abuse; domestic violence; drug
521 use; neglect; and many other reasons for which the state has
522 identified the children are in danger. As such, it is necessary
523 to protect the location of such children from being known by
524 their biological parents until the case has been litigated and
525 the children have been returned to their biological parents upon

526 satisfactory completion of their case plan and having their
527 parenting rights restored. As a result of being the person
528 ultimately responsible for the care of a child who is removed
529 from the home of his or her biological parents, owners and
530 operators of family foster homes may incur the ill will of the
531 biological parents, thus making such owners and operators and
532 their other children targets for acts of revenge. If such
533 identifying and location information is released, the safety of
534 the owners and operators of family foster homes and all children
535 living with them could be seriously jeopardized. The Legislature
536 further finds that the harm that may result from the release of
537 such personal identifying and location information outweighs any
538 public benefit that may be derived from the disclosure of the
539 information.
540 Section 3. This act shall take effect July 1, 2026.
