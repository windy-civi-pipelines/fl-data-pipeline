   13  Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Florida:
   14  
   15         Section 1.âSection 515.27, Florida Statutes, is amended to
   16  read:
   17         515.27âResidential swimming pool safety feature options;
   18  penalties.â
   19         (1)âIn order to pass final inspection and receive a
   20  certificate of completion, a residential swimming pool must meet
   21  at least one of the following requirements relating to pool
   22  safety features:
   23         (a)âThe pool must be isolated from access to a home by an
   24  enclosure that meets the pool barrier requirements of s. 515.29;
   25         (b)âThe pool must be equipped with an approved safety pool
   26  cover;
   27         (c)âAll doors and windows providing direct access from the
   28  home to the pool must be equipped with an exit alarm that has a
   29  minimum sound pressure rating of 85 dB A at 10 feet;
   30         (d)âAll doors providing direct access from the home to the

   42  designed for individual use, such as an alarm attached to a
   43  child that sounds when the child exceeds a certain distance or

   65  offered within 45 days after issuance of the citation.

   67  Statutes, is amended to read:

   82  programs, as provided in rule of the department.
