26 deliver over such money and property upon demand shall be deemed
27 a conversion. This is not to preclude the retention of money or
28 other property upon which the chiropractic physician has a valid
29 lien for services or to preclude the payment of agreed fees from
30 the proceeds of transactions for examinations or treatments.
31 Controversies as to the amount of the fees are not grounds for
32 disciplinary proceedings unless the amount demanded is clearly
33 excessive or extortionate, or the demand is fraudulent. All
34 funds of patients paid to a chiropractic physician, other than
35 advances for costs and expenses, shall be deposited into one or
36 more identifiable bank accounts maintained in the state in which
37 the chiropractic physician's office is situated, and funds
38 belonging to the chiropractic physician may not be deposited
39 therein except as follows:
40 1. Funds reasonably sufficient to pay bank charges may be
41 deposited therein.
42 2. Funds belonging in part to a patient and in part
43 presently or potentially to the physician must be deposited
44 therein, but the portion belonging to the physician may be
45 withdrawn when due unless the right of the physician to receive
46 it is disputed by the patient, in which event the disputed
47 portion may not be withdrawn until the dispute is finally
48 resolved.
