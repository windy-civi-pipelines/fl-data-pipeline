HB 297 2026
26 Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Florida:
27
28 Section 1. Subsection (1) of section 921.002, Florida
29 Statutes, is amended to read:
30 921.002 The Criminal Punishment Code.—The Criminal
31 Punishment Code shall apply to all felony offenses, except
32 capital felonies, committed on or after October 1, 1998.
33 (1) The provision of criminal penalties and of limitations
34 upon the application of such penalties is a matter of
35 predominantly substantive law and, as such, is a matter properly
36 addressed by the Legislature. The Legislature, in the exercise
37 of its authority and responsibility to establish sentencing
38 criteria, to provide for the imposition of criminal penalties,
39 and to make the best use of state prisons so that violent
40 criminal offenders are appropriately punished and rehabilitated
41 incarcerated, has determined that it is in the best interest of
42 the state to develop, implement, and revise a sentencing policy.
43 The Criminal Punishment Code embodies the principles that:
44 (a) Sentencing is neutral with respect to race, gender,
45 and social and economic status.
46 (b) The dual purposes primary purpose of sentencing in the
47 criminal justice system are is to punish the offender and
48 rehabilitate the offender to transition back to the community
49 successfully. Rehabilitation is a desired goal of the criminal
50 justice system but is subordinate to the goal of punishment.

HB 297 2026
51 (c) The penalty imposed is commensurate with the severity
52 of the primary offense and the circumstances surrounding the
53 primary offense.
54 (d) The severity of the sentence increases with the length
55 and nature of the offender's prior record.
56 (e) The sentence imposed by the sentencing judge reflects
57 the length of actual time to be served, shortened only by the
58 application of outstanding deed incentive and meritorious gain-
59 time, good behavior time, and rehabilitation credits as provided
60 by law, and may not be shortened if the defendant would
61 consequently serve less than 72 85 percent of his or her term of
62 imprisonment as provided in s. 944.275(4). The provisions of
63 Chapter 947, relating to parole, does shall not apply to persons
64 sentenced under the Criminal Punishment Code.
65 (f) Departures below the lowest permissible sentence
66 established by the code must be articulated in writing by the
67 trial court judge and made only when circumstances or factors
68 reasonably justify the mitigation of the sentence. The level of
69 proof necessary to establish facts that support a departure from
70 the lowest permissible sentence is a preponderance of the
71 evidence.
72 (g) The trial court judge may impose a sentence up to and
73 including the statutory maximum for any offense, including an
74 offense that is before the court due to a violation of probation
75 or community control.

77 departs from the Criminal Punishment Code only if the sentence
78 is below the lowest permissible sentence or as enumerated in s.
79 924.06(1).
80 (i) Use of incarcerative sanctions is prioritized toward
81 offenders convicted of serious offenses and certain offenders
82 who have long prior records, in order to maximize the finite
83 capacities of state and local correctional facilities.
