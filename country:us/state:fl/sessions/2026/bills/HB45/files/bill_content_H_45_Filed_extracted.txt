127 commission may designate another 8-hour period if the offender's

HB 45 2026
126 1. A mandatory curfew from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. The
127 commission may designate another 8-hour period if the offender's
128 employment precludes the above specified time, and such
129 alternative is recommended by the Department of Corrections. If
130 the commission determines that imposing a curfew would endanger
131 the victim, the commission may consider alternative sanctions.

153 district school board may not establish or relocate a public
154 school bus stop within 1,000 feet of the residence of a releasee
155 who is subject to this subparagraph. The failure of the district
156 school board to comply with this subparagraph shall not result
157 in a violation of conditional release supervision. A releasee
158 who is subject to this subparagraph may not be forced to
159 relocate and does not violate his or her conditional release
160 supervision if he or she is living in a residence that meets the

171 participate in other appropriate therapy.
172 4. A prohibition on any contact with the victim, directly
173 or indirectly, including through a third person, unless approved
174 by the victim, a qualified practitioner in the sexual offender

181 qualified practitioner who is basing the recommendation on a
182 risk assessment. Further, the sex offender must be currently
