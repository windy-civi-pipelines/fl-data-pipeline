262 the intent of the Legislature that brownfield redevelopment
263 activities be viewed as opportunities to significantly improve
264 the utilization, general condition, and appearance of these
265 sites. Different standards than those in place for new
266 development, as allowed under current state and local laws,
267 should be used to the fullest extent to encourage the
268 redevelopment of a brownfield. State and local governments are
269 encouraged to offer redevelopment incentives for this purpose,
270 as an ongoing public investment in infrastructure and services,
271 to help eliminate the public health and environmental hazards,
272 and to promote the creation of jobs in these areas. Such
273 incentives may include financial, regulatory, and technical
274 assistance to persons and businesses involved in the
275 redevelopment of the brownfield pursuant to this act.
