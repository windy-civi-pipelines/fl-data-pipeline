   28  Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Florida:
   29  
   30         Section 1.âSection 408.910, Florida Statutes, is amended to
   31  read:

   33         (1)âLEGISLATIVE INTENT.âThe Legislature finds that a
   34  significant number of <u class="Insert">employers and employees in</u> <s class="Remove">the residents</s>
   35  <s class="Remove">of</s> this state do not have adequate access to affordable, quality
   36  health <u class="Insert">insurance that meets their needs</u> <s class="Remove">care</s>. The Legislature
   37  further finds that <u class="Insert">individual coverage health reimbursement</u>
   38  <u class="Insert">arrangements offer a novel way for employers of any size to give</u>
   39  <u class="Insert">health care contributions directly to employees to empower them</u>
   40  <u class="Insert">to choose their own health plan in a broad marketplace based on</u>
   41  <u class="Insert">individual financial needs and health factors. The Legislature</u>
   42  <u class="Insert">further finds that</u> increasing access to affordable, quality
   43  health care <u class="Insert">through individual coverage health reimbursement</u>
   44  <u class="Insert">arrangements</u> can be best accomplished by establishing a
   45  competitive <u class="Insert">marketplace</u> <s class="Remove">market</s> for <u class="Insert">employees who receive</u>

   53  <u class="Insert">this state</u> <s class="Remove">and health services</s>.
   54         (b)â<u class="Insert">Create a platform that streamlines the purchase of</u>
   55  <u class="Insert">individual coverage for employees enrolled in individual</u>
   56  <u class="Insert">coverage health reimbursement arrangements</u> <s class="Remove">Preserve the benefits</s>
   57  <s class="Remove">of employment-sponsored insurance while easing the</s>
   58  <s class="Remove">administrative burden for employers who offer these benefits</s>.

   66         (f)âSponsor a competitive <u class="Insert">marketplace</u> <s class="Remove">market</s> that
