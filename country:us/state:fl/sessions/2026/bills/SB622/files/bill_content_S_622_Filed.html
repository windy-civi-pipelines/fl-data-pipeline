   76         947.13âPowers and duties of commission.â
   77         (1)âThe commission shall have the powers and perform the
   78  duties of:
   79         (h)âDetermining what persons will be released on
   80  <u class="Insert">conditional geriatric release under s. 947.148,</u> conditional
   81  medical release under s. 947.149, establishing the conditions of

   83  and determining whether a person has violated the conditions of
   84  <u class="Insert">conditional geriatric release or</u> conditional medical release and
   85  taking action with respect to such a violation.
   86         Section 3.âSection 947.141, Florida Statutes, is amended to
   87  read:
   88         947.141âViolations of conditional release, control release,
   89  <u class="Insert">conditional geriatric release,</u> or conditional medical release or
   90  addiction-recovery supervision.â
   91         (1)âIf a member of the commission or a duly authorized
   92  representative of the commission has reasonable grounds to
   93  believe that an offender who is on release supervision under s.
   94  947.1405, s. 947.146, <u class="Insert">s. 947.148,</u> s. 947.149, or s. 944.4731 has
   95  violated the terms and conditions of the release in a material
   96  respect, such member or representative may cause a warrant to be
   97  issued for the arrest of the releasee; if the offender was found
   98  to be a sexual predator, the warrant must be issued.
   99         (2)âUpon the arrest on a felony charge of an offender who
  100  is on release supervision under s. 947.1405, s. 947.146, <u class="Insert">s.</u>
  101  <u class="Insert">947.148,</u> s. 947.149, or s. 944.4731, the offender must be
  102  detained without bond until the initial appearance of the
  103  offender at which a judicial determination of probable cause is
  104  made. If the trial court judge determines that there was no
  105  probable cause for the arrest, the offender may be released. If
  106  the trial court judge determines that there was probable cause
  107  for the arrest, such determination also constitutes reasonable
  108  grounds to believe that the offender violated the conditions of
  109  the release. Within 24 hours after the trial court judgeâs
  110  finding of probable cause, the detention facility administrator
  111  or designee shall notify the commission and the department of
  112  the finding and transmit to each a facsimile copy of the
  113  probable cause affidavit or the sworn offense report upon which
  114  the trial court judgeâs probable cause determination is based.
  115  The offender must continue to be detained without bond for a
  116  period not exceeding 72 hours excluding weekends and holidays
  117  after the date of the probable cause determination, pending a
  118  decision by the commission whether to issue a warrant charging
  119  the offender with violation of the conditions of release. Upon
  120  the issuance of the commissionâs warrant, the offender must
  121  continue to be held in custody pending a revocation hearing held
  122  in accordance with this section.
  123         (3)âWithin 45 days after notice to the Florida Commission
  124  on Offender Review of the arrest of a releasee charged with a
  125  violation of the terms and conditions of conditional release,
  126  control release, <u class="Insert">conditional geriatric release,</u> conditional
  127  medical release, or addiction-recovery supervision, the releasee
  128  must be afforded a hearing conducted by a commissioner or a duly
  129  authorized representative thereof. If the releasee elects to
  130  proceed with a hearing, the releasee must be informed orally and
  131  in writing of the following:
  132         (a)âThe alleged violation with which the releasee is
  133  charged.
  134         (b)âThe releaseeâs right to be represented by counsel.
  135         (c)âThe releaseeâs right to be heard in person.
  136         (d)âThe releaseeâs right to secure, present, and compel the
  137  attendance of witnesses relevant to the proceeding.
  138         (e)âThe releaseeâs right to produce documents on the
  139  releaseeâs own behalf.
  140         (f)âThe releaseeâs right of access to all evidence used
  141  against the releasee and to confront and cross-examine adverse
  142  witnesses.
  143         (g)âThe releaseeâs right to waive the hearing.
  144         (4)âWithin a reasonable time following the hearing, the
  145  commissioner or the commissionerâs duly authorized
  146  representative who conducted the hearing shall make findings of
  147  fact in regard to the alleged violation. A panel of no fewer
  148  than two commissioners shall enter an order determining whether
  149  the charge of violation of conditional release, control release,
  150  <u class="Insert">conditional geriatric release,</u> conditional medical release, or
  151  addiction-recovery supervision has been sustained based upon the
  152  findings of fact presented by the hearing commissioner or
  153  authorized representative. By such order, the panel may revoke
  154  conditional release, control release, <u class="Insert">conditional geriatric</u>
  155  <u class="Insert">release,</u> conditional medical release, or addiction-recovery
  156  supervision and thereby return the releasee to prison to serve
  157  the sentence imposed, reinstate the original order granting the
  158  release, or enter such other order as it considers proper.
  159  Effective for inmates whose offenses were committed on or after
  160  July 1, 1995, the panel may order the placement of a releasee,
  161  upon a finding of violation pursuant to this subsection, into a
  162  local detention facility as a condition of supervision.
  163         (5)âEffective for inmates whose offenses were committed on
  164  or after July 1, 1995, notwithstanding the provisions of ss.
  165  775.08, former 921.001, 921.002, 921.187, 921.188, 944.02, and
  166  951.23, or any other law to the contrary, by such order as
  167  provided in subsection (4), the panel, upon a finding of guilt,
  168  may, as a condition of continued supervision, place the releasee
  169  in a local detention facility for a period of incarceration not
  170  to exceed 22 months. Prior to the expiration of the term of
  171  incarceration, or upon recommendation of the chief correctional
  172  officer of that county, the commission shall cause inquiry into
  173  the inmateâs release plan and custody status in the detention
  174  facility and consider whether to restore the inmate to
  175  supervision, modify the conditions of supervision, or enter an
  176  order of revocation, thereby causing the return of the inmate to
  177  prison to serve the sentence imposed. The provisions of this
  178  section do not prohibit the panel from entering such other order
  179  or conducting any investigation that it deems proper. The
  180  commission may only place a person in a local detention facility
  181  pursuant to this section if there is a contractual agreement
  182  between the chief correctional officer of that county and the
  183  Department of Corrections. The agreement must provide for a per
  184  diem reimbursement for each person placed under this section,
  185  which is payable by the Department of Corrections for the
  186  duration of the offenderâs placement in the facility. This
  187  section does not limit the commissionâs ability to place a
  188  person in a local detention facility for less than 1 year.
  189         (6)âWhenever a conditional release, control release,
  190  <u class="Insert">conditional geriatric release,</u> conditional medical release, or
  191  addiction-recovery supervision is revoked by a panel of no fewer
  192  than two commissioners and the releasee is ordered to be
  193  returned to prison, the releasee, by reason of the misconduct,
  194  shall be deemed to have forfeited all gain-time or commutation
  195  of time for good conduct, as provided for by law, earned up to
  196  the date of release. However, if a conditional medical release
  197  is revoked due to the improved medical or physical condition of
  198  the releasee, the releasee shall not forfeit gain-time accrued
  199  before the date of conditional medical release. This subsection
  200  does not deprive the prisoner of the right to gain-time or
  201  commutation of time for good conduct, as provided by law, from
  202  the date of return to prison.
  203         (7)âIf a law enforcement officer has probable cause to
  204  believe that an offender who is on release supervision under s.
  205  947.1405, s. 947.146, <u class="Insert">s. 947.148,</u> s. 947.149, or s. 944.4731 has
  206  violated the terms and conditions of his or her release by
  207  committing a felony offense, the officer shall arrest the
  208  offender without a warrant, and a warrant need not be issued in
  209  the case.
  210         Section 4.âThis act shall take effect July 1, 2026.
