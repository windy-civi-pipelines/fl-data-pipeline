30 Section 1. Section 627.7015, Florida Statutes, is amended
31 to read:
32 627.7015 Mandatory mediation Alternative procedure for
33 resolution of disputed property insurance claims.—
34 (1) This section sets forth a nonadversarial alternative
35 dispute resolution procedure for a mediated claim resolution
36 conference prompted by the need for effective, fair, and timely
37 handling of property insurance claims. There is a particular
38 need for an informal, nonthreatening forum for helping parties
39 who elect this procedure to resolve their claims disputes
40 because most homeowner and commercial residential insurance
41 policies obligate policyholders to participate in a potentially
42 expensive and time-consuming adversarial appraisal process
43 before litigation. The procedure set forth in this section is
44 designed to bring the parties together for a mediated claims
45 settlement conference without any of the trappings or drawbacks
46 of an adversarial process. Before participating in resorting to
47 these procedures, policyholders and insurers are encouraged to
48 resolve claims as quickly and fairly as possible. This section
49 applies is available with respect to claims under personal lines
50 and commercial residential policies before commencing the

51 appraisal process, and mediation under this section is a
52 condition precedent to or before commencing litigation.
53 Mediation may be requested only by the policyholder, as a first-
54 party claimant, a third-party, as an assignee of the policy
55 benefits, or the insurer. However, An insurer is not required to
56 participate in any mediation requested by a third-party assignee
57 of the policy benefits. If requested by the policyholder,
58 Participation by legal counsel is permitted. Mediation under
59 this section is also required of available to litigants referred
60 to the department by a county court or circuit court. This
61 section does not apply to commercial coverages, to private
62 passenger motor vehicle insurance coverages, or to disputes
63 relating to liability coverages in policies of property
64 insurance.
65 (2) At the time of issuance and renewal of a policy or at
66 the time a first-party claim within the scope of this section is
67 filed by the policyholder, the insurer shall notify the
68 policyholder of its right to participate in the mandatory
69 mediation program under this section. A claim becomes eligible
70 for mediation after the insurer complies with s. 627.70131(7) or
71 elects to reinspect pursuant to s. 627.70152(4)(a)3. If the
72 insurer has not complied with s. 627.70131(7) or elected to
73 reinspect pursuant to s. 627.70152(4)(a)3. within 90 days after
74 notice of the loss, the insurer may not require mediation under
75 this section. This subsection does not impair the right of an

85 representatives, must attend the mediation, regardless of how it
86 is conducted. The costs of mediation must be reasonable, and the
87 insurer must bear all of the cost of conducting mediation
88 conferences, except as otherwise provided in this section. If a
89 named insured or his or her representative policyholder fails to
90 appear at the conference, thus preventing the mediation from
91 proceeding, the conference must be rescheduled upon the
92 policyholder's payment of the costs of a rescheduled conference.
93 If the insurer fails to appear at the conference, the insurer
94 must pay the policyholder's actual cash expenses incurred in
95 attending the conference if the insurer's failure to attend was
96 not due to a good cause acceptable to the department. An insurer
97 is will be deemed to have failed to appear if the insurer's
98 representative lacks authority to settle the full value of the
99 claim. The insurer shall incur an additional fee for a
100 rescheduled conference necessitated by the insurer's failure to

104 section and must be deposited in the Insurance Regulatory Trust
105 Fund. The department may suspend the insurer's authority to
106 appoint licensees if the insurer does not timely pay the
107 required fees. If a party elects to request an expert or a
108 representative to attend the mediation, that party must bear any
109 costs for the attendance of the expert or representative.
110 (4) The department shall adopt by rule a property
111 insurance mediation program to be administered by the department
112 or its designee. The department shall may also adopt special
113 rules that which are applicable in cases of an emergency within
