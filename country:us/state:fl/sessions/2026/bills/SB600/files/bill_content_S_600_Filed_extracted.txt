If the state does not respond 477 in writing within 10 days after receiving a written request to 478 seek a determination of extradition, the failure to respond is 479 evidence that the state is unwilling to seek extradition. 480 (5)âFor each felony warrant that a court issues, the state 481 shall enter the information of the defendant in the National 482 Crime Information Center database with no restrictions until the 483 defendant is returned to the jurisdiction of the court. 484 (6)âThe discharge of a forfeiture may shall not be ordered 485 for any reason other than as specified herein. 486 (7)âThe payment by a surety of a forfeiture under this law 487 has shall have the same effect on the bond as payment of a 488 judgment. 489 (8)âIf the defendant is arrested and returned to the county 490 of jurisdiction of the court or has posted a new bond for the 491 case at issue before judgment, the clerk must, upon affirmation 492 by the sheriff or the chief correctional officer and, shall, 493 without further hearing or order of the court, discharge the 494 forfeiture of the bond. However, if the surety agent fails to 495 pay the costs and expenses incurred in returning the defendant 496 to the county of jurisdiction, the clerk may shall not discharge 497 the forfeiture of the bond. If the surety agent and the sheriff 498 fail to agree on the amount of such said costs, then the court, 499 after notice to the sheriff and the state attorney, must shall 500 determine the amount of the costs. 501 (9)âIf, after forfeiture of a bond, the criminal charges 502 for which the bond guaranteed appearance are resolved, 503 adjudicated, or otherwise disposed of by any action of the court 504 or state, the clerk must discharge the forfeiture and issue such 505 notice to the surety without further order of the court. If such 506 resolution or disposition occurs after payment of a forfeiture 507 or judgment, remission must be granted upon proper motion and as 508 specified under s. 903.28. 509 (10)Â Unless the time for payment or discharge of the 510 forfeiture set forth in s. 903.27(1) has passed, or unless 511 payment of the forfeiture has already been made, the clerk does 512 not have standing to object to a motion to set aside a 513 forfeiture under paragraph (2)(b), a motion to discharge a 514 forfeiture under subsection (4), or a motion to reinstate a bond 515 under s. 903.31(2). 516 Section 15.âSection 903.27, Florida Statutes, is amended to 517 read: 518 903.27âForfeiture to judgment.â 519 (1)âIf the forfeiture is not paid or discharged by order of 520 a court of competent jurisdiction within 60 days after the 521 forfeiture notice has been mailed or electronically transmitted 522 and the bond is secured other than by money and bonds authorized 523 in s. 903.16, the clerk of the circuit court for the county 524 where the order was made must shall enter a judgment against the 525 surety for the amount of the penalty and issue execution. 526 However, in any case in which the bond forfeiture has been 527 discharged by the court of competent jurisdiction conditioned 528 upon the payment by the surety of certain costs or fees as 529 allowed by statute, the amount for which judgment may be entered 530 may not exceed the amount of the unpaid fees or costs upon which 531 the discharge had been conditioned. Judgment for the full amount 532 of the forfeiture may shall not be entered if payment of a 533 lesser amount will satisfy the conditions to discharge the 534 forfeiture. Within 5 10 days, the clerk shall furnish the 535 Department of Financial Services and the Office of Insurance 536 Regulation of the Financial Services Commission with a certified 537 copy of the judgment docket and shall furnish the surety company 538 at its home office a copy of the judgment, which shall include 539 the power of attorney number of the bond and the name of the 540 executing agent.

The clerk may furnish documents or 556 give notice as required in this subsection by mail or electronic 557 means. The clerk shall also immediately prepare and record in 558 the public records a satisfaction of the judgment or record the 559 order to vacate judgment.

If such mailing 570 or electronic delivery was properly accomplished as evidenced by 571 such certificate, the failure of a company to receive a copy of 572 the judgment as prescribed in subsection (1) does not constitute 573 a defense to the forfeiture and is not a ground for the 574 discharge, remission, reduction, set aside, or continuance of 575 such forfeiture. 576 (3)âSurety bail bonds may not be executed by a bail bond 577 agent or a bail bond agency against whom a judgment has been 578 entered which has remained unpaid for 35 days and may not be 579 executed for a company against whom a judgment has been entered 580 which has remained unpaid for 50 days.

If 591 a motion to set aside the judgment has been filed pursuant to 592 subsection (5), the amount submitted must shall be held in 593 escrow until such time as the court has disposed of the motion. 594 The failure to comply with the provisions of this subsection 595 constitutes a failure to pay the judgment. 596 (5)âAfter notice of judgment against the surety given by 597 the clerk of the circuit court, the surety, bail bond agency, or 598 bail bond agent may within 35 days file a motion to set aside 599 the judgment or to stay the judgment. It shall be a condition of 600 Any such motion or and of any order to stay the judgment must be 601 conditioned on payment by that the surety of pay the amount of 602 the judgment to the clerk, which amount must shall be held in 603 escrow until such time as the court has disposed of the motion 604 to set aside the judgment.

940 5.âThe defendant poses the threat of harm to the community. 941 The court may so conclude, if it finds that the defendant is 942 presently charged with a dangerous crime, that there is a 943 substantial probability that the defendant committed such crime, 944 that the factual circumstances of the crime indicate a disregard 945 for the safety of the community, and that there are no 946 conditions of release reasonably sufficient to protect the 947 community from the risk of physical harm to persons; 948 6.âThe defendant was on probation, parole, or other release 949 pending completion of sentence or on pretrial release for a 950 dangerous crime at the time the current offense was committed; 951 7.âThe defendant has violated one or more conditions of 952 pretrial release or bond for the offense currently before the 953 court and the violation, in the discretion of the court, 954 supports a finding that no conditions of release can reasonably 955 protect the community from risk of physical harm to persons or 956 assure the presence of the accused at trial; or 957 8.a.âThe defendant has ever been sentenced pursuant to s. 958 775.082(9) or s. 775.084 as a prison releasee reoffender, 959 habitual violent felony offender, three-time violent felony 960 offender, or violent career criminal, or the state attorney 961 files a notice seeking that the defendant be sentenced pursuant 962 to s. 775.082(9) or s. 775.084, as a prison releasee reoffender, 963 habitual violent felony offender, three-time violent felony 964 offender, or violent career criminal;

If the court finds a substantial probability 976 that the defendant committed the offense and, based on the 977 defendantâs past and present patterns of behavior, consideration 978 of the criteria in s. 903.046, and any other relevant facts, 979 that no conditions of release or bail will reasonably protect 980 the community from risk of physical harm, ensure the presence of 981 the defendant at trial, or assure the integrity of the judicial 982 process, the court must order pretrial detention. 983 (g)1.âIf a motion for pretrial detention is granted 984 required under paragraph (d), the pretrial detention hearing 985 must be held within 5 days after the defendantâs first 986 appearance hearing or, if there is no first appearance hearing, 987 within 5 days after the defendantâs arraignment. 988 2.âIf a state attorney files a motion for pretrial 989 detention under paragraph (c), the pretrial detention hearing 990 must be held within 5 days after the filing of such motion. 991 3.âThe defendant may request a continuance of a pretrial 992 detention hearing. No continuance shall be for longer than 5 993 days unless there are extenuating circumstances. The state 994 attorney shall be entitled to one continuance for good cause. 995 4.âThe defendant may be detained pending the completion of 996 the pretrial detention hearing. If a defendant is released on 997 bail pending a pretrial detention hearing under paragraph (d), 998 the court must inform the defendant that if he or she uses a 999 surety bond to meet the monetary component of pretrial release 1000 and the motion for pretrial detention is subsequently granted, 1001 the defendant will not be entitled to the return of the premium 1002 on such surety bond. 1003 Section 21.âSubsection (4) of section 648.45, Florida 1004 Statutes, is amended to read: 1005 648.45âActions against a licensee; suspension or revocation 1006 of eligibility to hold a license.â 1007 (4)âA Any licensee found to have violated s. 648.44(1)(b), 1008 (e), or (j) s. 648.44(1)(b), (d), or (i) shall, at a minimum, be 1009 suspended for a period of 3 months.
