  904         (c)âUpon motion by the state attorney, the court may order
  905  pretrial detention if it finds a substantial probability, based
  906  on a defendantâs past and present patterns of behavior, the
  907  criteria in s. 903.046, and any other relevant facts, that any
  908  of the following circumstances exist:
  909         1.âThe defendant has previously violated conditions of
  910  release and that no further conditions of release are reasonably
  911  likely to assure the defendantâs appearance at subsequent
  912  proceedings;
  913         2.âThe defendant, with the intent to obstruct the judicial
  914  process, has threatened, intimidated, or injured any victim,
  915  potential witness, juror, or judicial officer, or has attempted
  916  or conspired to do so, and that no condition of release will
  917  reasonably prevent the obstruction of the judicial process;
  918         3.âThe defendant is charged with trafficking in controlled
  919  substances as defined by s. 893.135, that there is a substantial
  920  probability that the defendant has committed the offense, and
  921  that no conditions of release will reasonably assure the
  922  defendantâs appearance at subsequent criminal proceedings;
  923         4.âThe defendant is charged with DUI manslaughter, as
  924  defined by s. 316.193, and that there is a substantial
  925  probability that the defendant committed the crime and that the
  926  defendant poses a threat of harm to the community; conditions
  927  that would support a finding by the court pursuant to this
  928  subparagraph that the defendant poses a threat of harm to the
  929  community include, but are not limited to, any of the following:
  930         a.âThe defendant has previously been convicted of any crime
  931  under s. 316.193, or of any crime in any other state or
  932  territory of the United States that is substantially similar to
  933  any crime under s. 316.193;
  934         b.âThe defendant was driving with a suspended driver
  935  license when the charged crime was committed; or
  936         c.âThe defendant has previously been found guilty of, or
  937  has had adjudication of guilt withheld for, driving while the
  938  defendantâs driver license was suspended or revoked in violation
  939  of s. 322.34;
  940         5.âThe defendant poses the threat of harm to the community.
  941  The court may so conclude, if it finds that the defendant is
  942  presently charged with a dangerous crime, that there is a
  943  substantial probability that the defendant committed such crime,
  944  that the factual circumstances of the crime indicate a disregard
  945  for the safety of the community, and that there are no
  946  conditions of release reasonably sufficient to protect the
  947  community from the risk of physical harm to persons;
  948         6.âThe defendant was on probation, parole, or other release
  949  pending completion of sentence or on pretrial release for a
  950  dangerous crime at the time the current offense was committed;
  951         7.âThe defendant has violated one or more conditions of
  952  pretrial release or bond for the offense currently before the
  953  court and the violation, in the discretion of the court,
  954  supports a finding that no conditions of release can reasonably
  955  protect the community from risk of physical harm to persons or
  956  assure the presence of the accused at trial; or
  957         8.a.âThe defendant has ever been sentenced pursuant to s.
  958  775.082(9) or s. 775.084 as a prison releasee reoffender,
  959  habitual violent felony offender, three-time violent felony
  960  offender, or violent career criminal, or the state attorney
  961  files a notice seeking that the defendant be sentenced pursuant
  962  to s. 775.082(9) or s. 775.084, as a prison releasee reoffender,
  963  habitual violent felony offender, three-time violent felony
  964  offender, or violent career criminal;
  965         b.âThere is a substantial probability that the defendant
  966  committed the offense; and
  967         c.âThere are no conditions of release that can reasonably
  968  protect the community from risk of physical harm or ensure the
  969  presence of the accused at trial.
  970         (d)âIf a defendant is arrested for a dangerous crime that
  971  is a capital felony, a life felony, or a felony of the first
  972  degree, and the court determines there is probable cause to
  973  believe the defendant committed the offense, the state attorney,
  974  or the court on its own motion, <u class="Insert">may move</u> <s class="Remove">s</s><s class="Remove">hall motion</s> for
  975  pretrial detention. If the court finds a substantial probability
  976  that the defendant committed the offense and, based on the
  977  defendantâs past and present patterns of behavior, consideration
  978  of the criteria in s. 903.046, and any other relevant facts,
  979  that no conditions of release or bail will reasonably protect
  980  the community from risk of physical harm, ensure the presence of
  981  the defendant at trial, or assure the integrity of the judicial
  982  process, the court must order pretrial detention.
  983         (g)1.âIf a motion for pretrial detention is <u class="Insert">granted</u>
  984  <s class="Remove">required</s> under paragraph (d), the pretrial detention hearing
  985  must be held within 5 days after the defendantâs first
  986  appearance hearing or, if there is no first appearance hearing,
  987  within 5 days after the defendantâs arraignment.
  988         2.âIf a state attorney files a motion for pretrial
  989  detention under paragraph (c), the pretrial detention hearing
  990  must be held within 5 days after the filing of such motion.
  991         3.âThe defendant may request a continuance of a pretrial
  992  detention hearing. No continuance shall be for longer than 5
  993  days unless there are extenuating circumstances. The state
  994  attorney shall be entitled to one continuance for good cause.
  995         4.âThe defendant may be detained pending the completion of
  996  the pretrial detention hearing. If a defendant is released on
  997  bail pending a pretrial detention hearing under paragraph (d),
  998  the court must inform the defendant that if he or she uses a
  999  surety bond to meet the monetary component of pretrial release
 1000  and the motion for pretrial detention is subsequently granted,
 1001  the defendant will not be entitled to the return of the premium
 1002  on such surety bond.
