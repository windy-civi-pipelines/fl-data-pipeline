412 specified in sub-subparagraph 2.z. and that is not the employer
413 of the congressional member, public officer, or other person

458 6. The exemptions in this paragraph apply to information
459 held by an agency before, on, or after the effective date of the
460 exemption.
461 7. Information made exempt under this paragraph may be
462 disclosed pursuant to s. 28.2221 to a title insurer authorized

476 removed information must be notarized, must confirm that a
477 protected party's request for release is pursuant to a
478 conveyance of his or her dwelling location, and must specify the
479 Official Records book and page, instrument number, or clerk's
480 file number for each document containing the information to be
481 released.
482 9. Upon the death of a protected party as verified by a
483 certified copy of a death certificate or court order, any party
484 can request the county recorder to release a protected
485 decedent's removed information unless there is a related request
486 on file with the county recorder for continued removal of the
487 decedent's information or unless such removal is otherwise
488 prohibited by statute or by court order. The written request to
489 release the removed information upon the death of a protected
490 party must attach the certified copy of a death certificate or
491 court order and must be notarized, must confirm the request for
492 release is due to the death of a protected party, and must
493 specify the Official Records book and page number, instrument
494 number, or clerk's file number for each document containing the
495 information to be released. A fee may not be charged for the
496 release of any document pursuant to such request.
497 Section 2. The Legislature finds that it is a public
498 necessity that the home addresses, telephone numbers, dates of
499 birth, places of employment, and photographs of current and
500 former emergency physicians; the names, home addresses,

501 telephone numbers, and places of employment of the spouses and
502 children of such emergency physicians; and the names and
503 locations of schools and day care facilities attended by the
504 children of such emergency physicians be exempt from s.
505 119.07(1), Florida Statutes, and s. 24(a), Article I of the
506 State Constitution. Emergency physicians, by the nature of their
507 duties, are often placed in traumatic circumstances in which
508 loss of life and severe bodily injuries have occurred. Such
509 emergency physicians are particularly vulnerable to physical
510 violence, harassment, and intimidation perpetrated by patients
511 or relatives of patients who may be violent, angry, or mentally
512 unstable. As a result, the Legislature finds that the release of
513 identifying and location information of emergency physicians and
514 the spouses and children of such emergency physicians may place
515 such emergency physicians and their spouses and children in
516 danger of being physically or emotionally harmed or stalked by a
517 person who has a hostile reaction to his or her encounter with
518 such emergency physician. The Legislature further finds that the
519 harm that may result from the release of such identifying and
520 location information outweighs any public benefit that may be
521 derived from the disclosure of the information.
522 Section 3. This act shall take effect July 1, 2026.
