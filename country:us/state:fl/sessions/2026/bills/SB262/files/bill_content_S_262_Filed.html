   12  Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Florida:

   14         Section 1.âSection 499.0121, Florida Statutes, is amended

   16         499.0121âStorage and handling of prescription drugs;
   17  recordkeeping.â<s class="Remove">The department shall adopt rules to implement</s>
   18  <s class="Remove">this section as necessary to protect the public health, safety,</s>
   19  <s class="Remove">and welfare. Such rules shall include, but not be limited to,</s>
   20  <s class="Remove">requirements for the storage and handling of prescription drugs</s>
   21  <s class="Remove">and for the establishment and maintenance of prescription drug</s>
   22  <s class="Remove">distribution records.</s>
   23         (1)âESTABLISHMENTS.âAn establishment at which prescription
   24  drugs are stored, warehoused, handled, held, offered, marketed,
   25  or displayed must:
   26         (a)âBe of suitable size and construction to facilitate
   27  cleaning, maintenance, and proper operations;
   28         (b)âHave storage areas designed to provide adequate
   29  lighting, ventilation, temperature, sanitation, humidity, space,
   30  equipment, and security conditions;
   31         (c)âHave a quarantine area for storage of prescription

   34  containers that have been opened;
   35         (d)âBe maintained in a clean and orderly condition; and
   36         (e)âBe free from infestation by insects, rodents, birds, or
   37  vermin of any kind.
   38         (2)âSECURITY.â

   40  distribution must be secure from unauthorized entry.
   41         1.âAccess from outside the premises must be kept to a
   42  minimum and be well controlled.
   43         2.âThe outside perimeter of the premises must be well
   44  lighted.
   45         3.âEntry into areas where prescription drugs are held must
   46  be limited to authorized personnel.

   48  distribution must be equipped with:
   49         1.âAn alarm system to detect entry after hours; however,
   50  the department may exempt by rule establishments that only hold
   51  a permit as prescription drug wholesale distributor-brokers; and
   52         2.âA security system that will provide suitable protection
   53  against theft and diversion. When appropriate, the security
   54  system must provide protection against theft or diversion that
   55  is facilitated or hidden by tampering with computers or
   56  electronic records.
   57         (c)âAny vehicle that contains prescription drugs must be
   58  secure from unauthorized access to the prescription drugs in the
   59  vehicle.
   60         (3)âSTORAGE.âAll prescription drugs shall be stored at
   61  appropriate temperatures and under appropriate conditions in
   62  accordance with requirements, if any, in the labeling of such
   63  drugs, or with requirements in the official compendium.
   64         (a)âIf no storage requirements are established for a
   65  prescription drug, the drug may be held at âcontrolledâ room
   66  temperature, as defined in the official compendium, to help
   67  ensure that its identity, strength, quality, and purity are not
   68  adversely affected.
   69         (b)âAppropriate manual, electromechanical, or electronic
   70  temperature and humidity recording equipment, devices, or logs
   71  must be used to document proper storage of prescription drugs.
   72         (c)âThe recordkeeping requirements in subsection (6) must
   73  be followed for all stored prescription drugs.
   74         (4)âEXAMINATION OF MATERIALS AND RECORDS.â
   75         (a)âUpon receipt, each outside shipping container must be
   76  visually examined for identity and to prevent the acceptance of
   77  contaminated prescription drugs that are otherwise unfit for
   78  distribution. This examination must be adequate to reveal
   79  container damage that would suggest possible contamination or
   80  other damage to the contents.
   81         (b)âEach outgoing shipment must be carefully inspected for
   82  identity of the prescription drug products and to ensure that
   83  there is no delivery of prescription drugs that have expired or
   84  been damaged in storage or held under improper conditions.
   85         (c)âThe recordkeeping requirements in subsection (6) must
   86  be followed for all incoming and outgoing prescription drugs.
   87         (d)âUpon receipt, a wholesale distributor must review
   88  records required under this section for the acquisition of
   89  prescription drugs for accuracy and completeness, considering
   90  the total facts and circumstances surrounding the transactions
   91  and the wholesale distributors involved.
   92         (5)âRETURNED, DAMAGED, OR OUTDATED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.â
   93         (a)1.âPrescription drugs that are outdated, damaged,
   94  deteriorated, misbranded, or adulterated must be quarantined and
   95  physically separated from other prescription drugs until they
   96  are destroyed or returned to their supplier. A quarantine
   97  section must be separate and apart from other sections where
   98  prescription drugs are stored so that prescription drugs in this
   99  section are not confused with usable prescription drugs.
  100         2.âPrescription drugs must be examined at least every 12
  101  months, and drugs for which the expiration date has passed must
  102  be removed and quarantined.
  103         (b)âAny prescription drugs of which the immediate or sealed
  104  outer containers or sealed secondary containers have been opened
  105  or used must be identified as such and must be quarantined and
  106  physically separated from other prescription drugs until they
  107  are destroyed or returned to the supplier.
  108         (c)âIf the conditions under which a prescription drug has
  109  been returned cast doubt on the drugâs safety, identity,
  110  strength, quality, or purity, the drug must be destroyed or
  111  returned to the supplier, unless examination, testing, or other
  112  investigation proves that the drug meets appropriate standards
  113  of safety, identity, strength, quality, and purity. In
  114  determining whether the conditions under which a drug has been
  115  returned cast doubt on the drugâs safety, identity, strength,
  116  quality, or purity, the wholesale distributor must consider,
  117  among other things, the conditions under which the drug has been
  118  held, stored, or shipped before or during its return and the
  119  conditions of the drug and its container, carton, or labeling,
  120  as a result of storage or shipping.
  121         (d)âThe recordkeeping requirements in subsection (6) must
  122  be followed for all outdated, damaged, deteriorated, misbranded,
  123  or adulterated prescription drugs.
  124         (6)âRECORDKEEPING.âThe department shall adopt rules that
  125  require keeping such records of prescription drugs, including
  126  active pharmaceutical ingredients, as are necessary for the

  189  within this state must be maintained at an establishment that is

  192         (f)âRecords required to be kept pursuant to this subsection

  207  the department with a written list of all wholesale distributors
  208  and manufacturers from whom the wholesale distributor purchases
  209  prescription drugs. A wholesale distributor, except a

  245  provide for written documentation of the disposition of outdated
  246  prescription drugs. This documentation must be maintained for 2
  247  years after disposition of the outdated drugs.
  248         (9)âRESPONSIBLE PERSONS.âWholesale distributors must
  249  establish and maintain lists of officers, directors, managers,
  250  designated representatives, and other persons in charge of
  251  wholesale drug distribution, storage, and handling, including a
  252  description of their duties and a summary of their
  253  qualifications.
  254         (10)âCOMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL LAW.âA
  255  wholesale distributor must operate in compliance with applicable
  256  federal, state, and local laws and regulations.
  257         (a)âA wholesale distributor must allow the department and
  258  authorized federal, state, and local officials to enter and
  259  inspect its premises and delivery vehicles, and to audit its
  260  records and written operating procedures, at reasonable times
  261  and in a reasonable manner, to the extent authorized by law.
  262         (b)âA wholesale distributor that deals in controlled
  263  substances must register with the Drug Enforcement
  264  Administration and must comply with all applicable state, local,
  265  and federal laws. A wholesale distributor that distributes any
  266  substance controlled under chapter 893 must notify the
  267  department when registering with the Drug Enforcement
  268  Administration pursuant to that chapter and must provide the
  269  department with its DEA number.
  270         (11)âSALVAGING AND REPROCESSING.âA wholesale distributor is
  271  subject to any applicable federal, state, or local laws or
  272  regulations that relate to prescription drug product salvaging
  273  or reprocessing.
  274         (12)âSHIPPING AND TRANSPORTATION.âThe person responsible
  275  for shipment and transportation of a prescription drug in a
  276  wholesale distribution may use a common carrier; its own vehicle
  277  or employee acting within the scope of employment if authorized
  278  under s. 499.03 for the possession of prescription drugs in this
  279  state; or, in the case of a prescription drug intended for
  280  domestic distribution, an independent contractor who must be the
  281  agent of the authorized seller or recipient responsible for
  282  shipping and transportation as set forth in a written contract
  283  between the parties. A person selling a prescription drug for
  284  export must obtain documentation, such as a validated airway
  285  bill, bill of lading, or other appropriate documentation that
  286  the prescription drug was exported. A person responsible for
  287  shipping or transporting prescription drugs is not required to
  288  maintain documentation from a common carrier that the designated
  289  recipient received the prescription drugs; however, the person
  290  must obtain such documentation from the common carrier and make
  291  it available to the department upon request of the department.
  292         (13)âDUE DILIGENCE OF SUPPLIERS.âPrior to purchasing any
  293  prescription drugs from another wholesale distributor, a

  296  repackager must:

  298  distributor by which the selling wholesale distributor will
  299  indemnify the purchasing wholesale distributor for any loss
  300  caused to the purchasing wholesale distributor related to the
  301  purchase of drugs from the selling wholesale distributor which
  302  are determined to be counterfeit or to have been distributed in
  303  violation of any federal or state law governing the distribution
  304  of drugs.
  305         (b)âDetermine that the selling wholesale distributor has
  306  insurance coverage of not less than the greater of 1 percent of
  307  the amount of total dollar volume of the prescription drug sales
  308  reported to the department under s. 499.012(8)(g) or $500,000;
  309  however the coverage need not exceed $2 million.
  310         (c)âObtain information from the selling wholesale
  311  distributor, including the length of time the selling wholesale
  312  distributor has been licensed in this state, a copy of the
  313  selling wholesale distributorâs licenses or permits, and
  314  background information concerning the ownership of the selling
  315  wholesale distributor, including the experience of the wholesale
  316  distributor in the wholesale distribution of prescription drugs.
  317         (d)âVerify that the selling wholesale distributorâs Florida
  318  permit is valid.
  319         (e)âInspect the selling wholesale distributorâs licensed
  320  establishment to document that it has a policies and procedures
  321  manual relating to the distribution of drugs, the appropriate
  322  temperature controlled environment for drugs requiring
  323  temperature control, an alarm system, appropriate access
  324  restrictions, and procedures to ensure that records related to
  325  the wholesale distribution of prescription drugs are maintained
  326  as required by law:
  327         1.âBefore purchasing any drug from the wholesale
  328  distributor, and at least once each subsequent year; or
  329         2.âBefore purchasing any drug from the wholesale
  330  distributor, and each subsequent year obtain a complete copy of
  331  the most recent inspection report for the establishment which
  332  was prepared by the department or the regulatory authority
  333  responsible for wholesale distributors in the state in which the
  334  establishment is located.
  335         (14)âDISTRIBUTION REPORTING.âEach prescription drug
  336  wholesale distributor, out-of-state prescription drug wholesale

  353  the 20th of the next month, in the electronic format used for
  354  controlled substance reporting to the Automation of Reports and
  355  Consolidated Orders System division of the federal Drug

  368         (d)âThe National Drug Code identifier of the product and
  369  the quantity distributed or received.
  370         (e)âThe Drug Enforcement Administration Form 222 number or

  372  II transactions.
  373         (f)âThe date of the transaction.
  374  
  375  The department must share the reported data with the Department
  376  of Law Enforcement and local law enforcement agencies upon
  377  request and must monitor purchasing to identify purchasing
  378  levels that are inconsistent with the purchasing entityâs
  379  clinical needs. The Department of Law Enforcement shall
  380  investigate purchases at levels that are inconsistent with the
  381  purchasing entityâs clinical needs to determine whether
  382  violations of chapter 893 have occurred.
  383         (15)âDUE DILIGENCE OF PURCHASERS.â
  384         (a)âEach prescription drug wholesale distributor, out-of
  385  state prescription drug wholesale distributor, and retail
  386  pharmacy drug wholesale distributor must establish and maintain
  387  policies and procedures to credential physicians licensed under
  388  chapter 458, chapter 459, chapter 461, or chapter 466 and
  389  pharmacies that purchase or otherwise receive from the wholesale
  390  distributor controlled substances listed in Schedule II or
  391  Schedule III as provided in s. 893.03. The prescription drug
  392  wholesale distributor, out-of-state prescription drug wholesale
  393  distributor, or retail pharmacy drug wholesale distributor shall
  394  maintain records of such credentialing and make the records
  395  available to the department upon request. Such credentialing
  396  must, at a minimum, include:
  397         1.âA determination of the clinical nature of the receiving
  398  entity, including any specialty practice area.
  399         2.âA review of the receiving entityâs history of Schedule
  400  II and Schedule III controlled substance purchasing from the
  401  wholesale distributor.
  402         3.âA determination that the receiving entityâs Schedule II
  403  and Schedule III controlled substance purchasing history, if
  404  any, is consistent with and reasonable for that entityâs
  405  clinical business needs.
  406         (b)âA wholesale distributor must take reasonable measures
  407  to identify its customers, understand the normal and expected
  408  transactions conducted by those customers, and identify those
  409  transactions that are suspicious in nature. A wholesale
  410  distributor must establish internal policies and procedures for
  411  identifying suspicious orders and preventing suspicious
  412  transactions. A wholesale distributor must assess orders for
  413  more than 7,500 unit doses of any one controlled substance in
  414  any one month to determine whether the purchase is reasonable.
  415  In making such assessments, a wholesale distributor may consider
  416  the purchasing entityâs clinical business needs, location, and
  417  population served, in addition to other factors established in
  418  the distributorâs policies and procedures. A wholesale
  419  distributor must report to the department any regulated
  420  transaction involving an extraordinary quantity of a listed
  421  chemical, an uncommon method of payment or delivery, or any
  422  other circumstance that the regulated person believes may
  423  indicate that the listed chemical will be used in violation of
  424  the law. The wholesale distributor shall maintain records that
  425  document the report submitted to the department in compliance
  426  with this paragraph.
  427         (c)âA wholesale distributor may not distribute controlled
  428  substances to an entity if any criminal history record check for
  429  any person associated with that entity shows that the person has
  430  been convicted of, or entered a plea of guilty or nolo
  431  contendere to, regardless of adjudication, a crime in any
  432  jurisdiction related to controlled substances, the practice of
  433  pharmacy, or the dispensing of medicinal drugs.
