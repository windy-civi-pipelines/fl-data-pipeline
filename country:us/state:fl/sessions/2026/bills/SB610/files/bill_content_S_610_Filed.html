   21  Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Florida:
   22  
   23         Section 1.âSection 515.27, Florida Statutes, is amended to
   24  read:
   25         515.27âResidential swimming pool safety feature options;
   26  penalties.â
   27         (1)âIn order to pass final inspection and receive a
   28  certificate of completion, a residential swimming pool must meet
   29  at least one of the following requirements relating to pool
   30  safety features:
   31         (a)âThe pool must be isolated from access to a home by an
   32  enclosure that meets the pool barrier requirements of s. 515.29;
   33         (b)âThe pool must be equipped with an approved safety pool
   34  cover;
   35         (c)âAll doors and windows providing direct access from the
   36  home to the pool must be equipped with an exit alarm that has a
   37  minimum sound pressure rating of 85 dB A at 10 feet;
   38         (d)âAll doors providing direct access from the home to the
   39  pool must be equipped with a self-closing, self-latching device
   40  with a release mechanism placed no lower than 54 inches above
   41  the floor; or

   45  independently certified to ASTM Standard F2208, titled âStandard
   46  Safety Specification for Residential Pool Alarms,â which
   47  includes surface motion, pressure, sonar, laser, and infrared
   48  alarms. For purposes of this paragraph, the term âswimming pool
   49  alarmâ does not include any swimming protection alarm device
   50  designed for individual use, such as an alarm attached to a
   51  child that sounds when the child exceeds a certain distance or
   52  becomes submerged in water.

   77         Section 2.âSubsections (6) and (7) are added to section
   78  515.29, Florida Statutes, and subsection (1) of that section is
   79  republished, to read:
