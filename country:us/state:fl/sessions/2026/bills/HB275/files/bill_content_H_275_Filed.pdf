26 with the office at least annually. The corporation shall provide
27 any additional information regarding the rates which the office
28 requires. The office shall consider the recommendations of the
29 board and issue a final order establishing the rates for the
30 corporation within 45 days after the recommended rates are
31 filed. The corporation may not pursue an administrative
32 challenge or judicial review of the final order of the office.
33 2. In addition to the rates otherwise determined pursuant
34 to this paragraph, the corporation shall impose and collect an
35 amount equal to the premium tax provided in s. 624.509 to
36 augment the financial resources of the corporation.
37 3. After the public hurricane loss-projection model under
38 s. 627.06281 has been found to be accurate and reliable by the
39 Florida Commission on Hurricane Loss Projection Methodology, the
40 model shall be considered when establishing the windstorm
41 portion of the corporation's rates. The corporation may use the
42 public model results in combination with the results of private
43 models to calculate rates for the windstorm portion of the
44 corporation's rates. This subparagraph does not require or allow
45 the corporation to adopt rates lower than the rates otherwise
46 required or allowed by this paragraph.
47 4. The corporation must make a recommended actuarially
48 sound rate filing for each personal and commercial line of
49 business it writes.

63 7. The corporation's implementation of rates as prescribed
64 in subparagraphs 5. and 8. shall cease for any line of business
65 written by the corporation upon the corporation's implementation
66 of actuarially sound rates. Thereafter, the corporation shall

73 limitations in subparagraph 5., but may not be charged more than
74 50 percent above, nor less than, the prior year's established
