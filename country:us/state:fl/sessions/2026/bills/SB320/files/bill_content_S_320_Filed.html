 1002         2.âCost-of-living adjustment.âA district school board may
 1003  provide a cost-of-living salary adjustment if the adjustment:

 1096  state board which do not apply within the school district.
 1097         (IV)âAssignment of additional academic responsibilities.
 1098  
 1099  If budget constraints in any given year limit a district school
 1100  boardâs ability to fully fund all adopted salary schedules, the
