   25         (a)(1)âEvery person who has the legal or equitable title to
   26  real estate and maintains thereon the permanent residence of the
   27  owner, or another legally or naturally dependent upon the owner,
   28  shall be exempt from taxation thereon, except assessments for
   29  special benefits, as follows:

   33  assessed valuation greater than fifty thousand dollars and up to
   34  seventy-five thousand dollars,
   35  
   36  upon establishment of right thereto in the manner prescribed by
   37  law. The real estate may be held by legal or equitable title, by
   38  the entireties, jointly, in common, as a condominium, or
   39  indirectly by stock ownership or membership representing the
   40  ownerâs or memberâs proprietary interest in a corporation owning
   41  a fee or a leasehold initially in excess of ninety-eight years.
   42  The exemption shall not apply with respect to any assessment
   43  roll until such roll is first determined to be in compliance
   44  with the provisions of section 4 by a state agency designated by
   45  general law. This exemption is repealed on the effective date of
   46  any amendment to this Article which provides for the assessment
   47  of homestead property at less than just value.
   48         (2)âThe twenty-five thousand dollar amount of assessed
   49  valuation exempt from taxation provided in subparagraph (a)(1)b.

   51  inflation using the percent change in the Consumer Price Index
   52  for All Urban Consumers, U.S. City Average, all items 1967=100,
   53  or successor reports for the preceding calendar year as
   54  initially reported by the United States Department of Labor,
   55  Bureau of Labor Statistics, if such percent change is positive.
   56         (3)âThe amount of assessed valuation exempt from taxation
   57  for which every person who has the legal or equitable title to
   58  real estate and maintains thereon the permanent residence of the

   60  owner, is eligible, and which applies solely to levies other
   61  than school district levies, that is added to this constitution
   62  after January 1, 2025, shall be adjusted annually on January 1
   63  of each year for inflation using the percent change in the
   64  Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, U.S. City Average,
   65  all items 1967=100, or successor reports for the preceding
   66  calendar year as initially reported by the United States

   68  change is positive, beginning the year following the effective
   69  date of such exemption.
   70         (b)âNot more than one exemption shall be allowed any
   71  individual or family unit or with respect to any residential
   72  unit. No exemption shall exceed the value of the real estate
   73  assessable to the owner or, in case of ownership through stock
   74  or membership in a corporation, the value of the proportion
   75  which the interest in the corporation bears to the assessed
   76  value of the property.
   77         (c)âBy general law and subject to conditions specified
   78  therein, the Legislature may provide to renters, who are
   79  permanent residents, ad valorem tax relief on all ad valorem tax
   80  levies. Such ad valorem tax relief shall be in the form and

  119         (e)(1)âEach veteran who is age <u class="Insert">sixty-five</u> <s class="Remove">65</s> or older who
  120  is partially or totally permanently disabled <u class="Insert">and who does not</u>
  121  <u class="Insert">qualify for the exemption under subsection (d)</u> shall receive a
  122  discount from the amount of the ad valorem tax otherwise owed on
  123  homestead property the veteran owns and resides in if the
  124  disability was combat related and the veteran was honorably
  125  discharged upon separation from military service. The discount
  126  shall be in a percentage equal to the percentage of the
  127  veteranâs permanent, service-connected disability as determined
  128  by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. To qualify
  129  for the discount granted by this paragraph, an applicant must
  130  submit to the county property appraiser, by March 1, an official
  131  letter from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs
  132  stating the percentage of the veteranâs service-connected
  133  disability and such evidence that reasonably identifies the
  134  disability as combat related and a copy of the veteranâs
  135  honorable discharge. If the property appraiser denies the
  136  request for a discount, the appraiser must notify the applicant
  137  in writing of the reasons for the denial, and the veteran may
  138  reapply. The Legislature may, by general law, waive the annual
  139  application requirement in subsequent years.
  140         (2)âIf a veteran who receives the discount described in
  141  paragraph (1) predeceases his or her spouse, and if, upon the
  142  death of the veteran, the surviving spouse holds the legal or
  143  beneficial title to the homestead property and permanently
  144  resides thereon, the discount carries over to the surviving
  145  spouse until he or she remarries or sells or otherwise disposes
  146  of the homestead property. If the surviving spouse sells or
  147  otherwise disposes of the property, a discount not to exceed the
  148  dollar amount granted from the most recent ad valorem tax roll
  149  may be transferred to the surviving spouseâs new homestead
  150  property, if used as his or her permanent residence and he or
  151  she has not remarried.
  152         (3)âThis subsection is self-executing and does not require
  153  implementing legislation.
  154         (f)âBy general law and subject to conditions and
  155  limitations specified therein, the Legislature may provide ad
  156  valorem tax relief equal to the total amount or a portion of the
  157  ad valorem tax otherwise owed on homestead property to:
  158         (1)âThe surviving spouse of a veteran who died from
  159  service-connected causes while on active duty as a member of the
  160  United States Armed Forces.
  161         (2)âThe surviving spouse of a first responder who died in
  162  the line of duty.
  163         (3)âA first responder who is totally and permanently
  164  disabled as a result of an injury or injuries sustained in the
  165  line of duty. Causal connection between a disability and service
  166  in the line of duty shall not be presumed but must be determined
  167  as provided by general law. For purposes of this paragraph, the
  168  term âdisabilityâ does not include a chronic condition or
  169  chronic disease, unless the injury sustained in the line of duty
  170  was the sole cause of the chronic condition or chronic disease.
  171  
  172  As used in this subsection and as further defined by general
  173  law, the term âfirst responderâ means a law enforcement officer,
  174  a correctional officer, a firefighter, an emergency medical
  175  technician, or a paramedic, and the term âin the line of dutyâ
  176  means arising out of and in the actual performance of duty
  177  required by employment as a first responder.
