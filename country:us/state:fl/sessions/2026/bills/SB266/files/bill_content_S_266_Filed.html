    1                        A bill to be entitled                      
    2         An act relating to public adjuster contracts; amending
    3         s. 626.854, F.S.; authorizing certain persons to
    4         rescind a contract for public adjuster services;
    5         amending s. 626.8698, F.S.; clarifying the acts that
    6         may subject a public adjuster or public adjuster
    7         apprentice to discipline; amending s. 626.8796, F.S.;
    8         authorizing certain persons to rescind a contract for

   10          
   11  Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Florida:
   12  
   13         Section 1.âSubsection (7) of section 626.854, Florida
   14  Statutes, is amended to read:
   15         626.854ââPublic adjusterâ defined; prohibitions.âThe
   16  Legislature finds that it is necessary for the protection of the
   17  public to regulate public insurance adjusters and to prevent the
   18  unauthorized practice of law.
   19         (7)<u class="Insert">(a)</u>âAn insured or <u class="Insert">a</u> claimant may cancel a public
   20  adjusterâs contract to adjust a claim without penalty or
   21  obligation within 10 days after the date on which the contract
   22  is executed. If the contract was entered into based on events
   23  that are the subject of a declaration of a state of emergency by
   24  the Governor, an insured or <u class="Insert">a</u> claimant may cancel the public
   25  adjusterâs contract to adjust a claim without penalty or
   26  obligation within 30 days after the date of loss or 10 days
   27  after the date on which the contract is executed, whichever is
   28  longer. The public adjusterâs contract must contain the
   29  following language in minimum 18-point bold type immediately
   30  before the space reserved in the contract for the signature of
   31  the insured or claimant:
   32  
   33         <s class="Remove">â</s>You, the insured, may cancel this contract for any
   34         reason without penalty or obligation to you within 10
   35         days after the date of this contract. If this contract
   36         was entered into based on events that are the subject
   37         of a declaration of a state of emergency by the
   38         Governor, you may cancel this contract for any reason
   39         without penalty or obligation to you within 30 days
   40         after the date of loss or 10 days after the date on
   41         which the contract is executed, whichever is longer.
   42         You may also cancel the contract without penalty or
   43         obligation to you if I, as your public adjuster, fail
   44         to provide you and your insurer a copy of a written
   45         estimate within 60 days of the execution of the
   46         contract, unless the failure to provide the estimate
   47         within 60 days is caused by factors beyond my control,
   48         in accordance with s. 627.70131(5)(a)2., Florida
   49         Statutes. The 60-day cancellation period for failure
   50         to provide a written estimate shall cease on the date
   51         I have provided you with the written estimate.<s class="Remove">â</s>
