Any part of an agreement or contract 1236 that has the purpose or effect of concealing misconduct by 1237 educational support employees, instructional personnel, or 1238 school administrators which affects the health, safety, or 1239 welfare of a student is void, is contrary to public policy, and 1240 may not be enforced. 1241 (o)âBefore employing a person in any position that requires 1242 direct contact with students, conduct employment history checks 1243 of previous employers, screen the person through use of the 1244 screening tools described in s. 1001.10(5), and document the 1245 findings.
