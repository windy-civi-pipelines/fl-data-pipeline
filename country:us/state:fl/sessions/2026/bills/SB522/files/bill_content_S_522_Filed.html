  390  suitable place where the applicant can in good faith carry on

  413  vehicle dealer as defined in subparagraph (1)(c)5. is exempt

  415  <s class="Remove">personal injury protection insurance</s> on those vehicles that
  416  cannot be legally operated on roads, highways, or streets in

  418  insurance policy, and all other dealers must submit a garage
  419  liability insurance policy or a general liability insurance
  420  policy coupled with a business automobile policy. Such policy

  426  change in such policy or within 10 calendar days after any

  433  of $300 for the first year and $75 for the second year, in
  434  addition to any other fees required by law. An applicant for
  435  renewal shall pay to the department $75 for a 1-year renewal or
  436  $150 for a 2-year renewal, in addition to any other fees
  437  required by law. Upon making an application for a change of
  438  location, the <u class="Insert">applicant</u> <s class="Remove">person</s> shall pay a fee of $50 in
  439  addition to any other fees now required by law. The department
  440  shall, in the case of every application for initial licensure,
  441  verify whether certain facts set forth in the application are
  442  true. Each applicant, general partner in the case of a
  443  partnership, or corporate officer and director in the case of a
  444  corporate applicant <u class="Insert">shall</u><s class="Remove">, must</s> file a set of fingerprints with

  448  processing and forwarding to the Federal Bureau of Investigation
  449  for federal processing. The actual cost of state and federal
  450  processing <u class="Insert">must</u> <s class="Remove">shall</s> be borne by the applicant and is in
  451  addition to the fee for licensure. The department may issue a
  452  license to an applicant pending the results of the fingerprint
  453  investigation, which license is fully revocable if the
  454  department subsequently determines that any facts set forth in
  455  the application are not true or correctly represented.
  456         Section 9.âParagraph (j) of subsection (3) of section
  457  320.771, Florida Statutes, is amended to read:

  467  <s class="Remove">protection, and $10,000 personal injury protection,</s> if the
  468  applicant is to be licensed as a dealer in, or intends to sell,
  469  recreational vehicles. Such policy must be for the license
  470  period. Within 10 calendar days after any renewal or
  471  continuation of or material change in such policy or issuance of
  472  a new policy, the licensee shall deliver to the department, in a
  473  manner prescribed by the department, a copy of such renewed,
  474  continued, changed, or new policy. However, a garage liability
  475  policy is not required for the licensure of a mobile home dealer
  476  who sells only park trailers.
  477  
  478  The department shall, if it deems necessary, cause an
  479  investigation to be made to ascertain if the facts set forth in
  480  the application are true and shall not issue a license to the
  481  applicant until it is satisfied that the facts set forth in the
  482  application are true.
  483         Section 10.âSubsections (1) and (2) of section 322.251,

  493  envelope, first class, postage prepaid, addressed to the
  494  licensee at his or her last known mailing address furnished to
  495  the department. Such mailing by the department constitutes
  496  notification, and any failure by the person to receive the
  497  mailed order will not affect or stay the effective date or term
  498  of the cancellation, suspension, revocation, or disqualification
  499  of the licenseeâs driving privilege.
  500         (2)âThe giving of notice and an order of cancellation,
  501  suspension, revocation, or disqualification by mail is complete
  502  upon expiration of 20 days after deposit in the United States

  645  service, or adjustment by the motor vehicle dealer is immune
  646  from any cause of action and is not liable, vicariously or
  647  directly, under general law solely by reason of being the owner

  670  vehicle dealer, or the motor vehicle dealerâs leasing or rental
  671  affiliate, was in any way false, fraudulent, misleading,

 2495  insurance policy.
 2496         3.âThat the provision of rides for compensation which are

 2524  personal automobile insurance policy of the TNC driver or owner
 2525  of the TNC vehicle who are not occupying the TNC vehicle at the

 2528  driver is logged on to a digital network, while the TNC driver
 2529  is engaged in a prearranged ride, or while the TNC driver
 2530  otherwise uses a vehicle to transport riders for compensation.

 2578  that the motor vehicle insurance policy under subparagraph 1.:

 2603  program must provide the coverage required under paragraph (a),
 2604  beginning with the first dollar of a claim, and must defend such
 2605  claim, except under circumstances as set forth in subparagraph
 2606  (3)(a)2.
 2607         b.âCoverage under a motor vehicle insurance policy
 2608  maintained by the peer-to-peer car-sharing program must not be
 2609  dependent on another motor vehicle insurer first denying a
 2610  claim, and another motor vehicle insurance policy is not
 2611  required to first deny a claim.
 2612         c.âNotwithstanding any other law, statute, rule, or
 2613  regulation to the contrary, a peer-to-peer car-sharing program
 2614  has an insurable interest in a shared vehicle during the car
 2615  sharing period. This sub-subparagraph does not create liability
 2616  for a peer-to-peer car-sharing program for maintaining the
 2617  coverage required under paragraph (a) and under this paragraph,
 2618  if applicable.
 2619         d.âA peer-to-peer car-sharing program may own and maintain
 2620  as the named insured one or more policies of motor vehicle
 2621  insurance which provide coverage for:
 2622         (I)âLiabilities assumed by the peer-to-peer car-sharing
 2623  program under a peerâtoâpeer car-sharing program agreement;

 2625         (III)âLiability of the shared vehicle driver;
 2626         (IV)âDamage or loss to the shared motor vehicle; or
 2627         (V)âDamage, loss, or injury to persons or property to
 2628  satisfy the <s class="Remove">personal injury protection and</s> uninsured and
 2629  underinsured motorist coverage requirements of this section.
 2630         e.âInsurance required under paragraph (a), when maintained
 2631  by a peer-to-peer car-sharing program, may be provided by an
 2632  insurer authorized to do business in this state which is a
 2633  member of the Florida Insurance Guaranty Association or an
 2634  eligible surplus lines insurer that has a superior, excellent,
 2635  exceptional, or equivalent financial strength rating by a rating
 2636  agency acceptable to the office. A peer-to-peer car-sharing
 2637  program is not transacting in insurance when it maintains the
 2638  insurance required under this section.

 2650         2.âThe assumption of liability under subparagraph 1. does

 2653  misrepresentation or omission to the peer-to-peer car-sharing
 2654  program before the car-sharing period in which the loss occurs;

 2663  motor vehicle at the time of the loss, and the peer-to-peer car
 2664  sharing program does not have available, did not retain, or
 2665  fails to provide the information required under subsection (5);
 2666  or
 2667         b.âA dispute exists over whether the shared vehicle was
 2668  returned to the alternatively agreed-upon location as required
 2669  under subparagraph (1)(d)2.
 2670         (c)â<i>Exclusions in motor vehicle insurance policies.</i>âAn
 2671  authorized insurer that writes motor vehicle liability insurance
 2672  in this state may exclude any coverage and the duty to defend or
 2673  indemnify for any claim under a shared vehicle ownerâs motor
 2674  vehicle insurance policy, including, but not limited to:

 2683  This paragraph does not invalidate or limit any exclusion
 2684  contained in a motor vehicle insurance policy, including any
 2685  insurance policy in use or approved for use which excludes
 2686  coverage for motor vehicles made available for rent, sharing, or
 2687  hire or for any business use. This paragraph does not
 2688  invalidate, limit, or restrict an insurerâs ability under
 2689  existing law to underwrite, cancel, or nonrenew any insurance
 2690  policy.
