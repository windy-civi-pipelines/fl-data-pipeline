  494         Section 2.â<u class="Insert">The Legislature finds that it is a public</u>
  495  <u class="Insert">necessity that the home addresses, telephone numbers, dates of</u>
  496  <u class="Insert">birth, and photographs of current and former private</u>
  497  <u class="Insert">investigators licensed by the Department of Agriculture and</u>
  498  <u class="Insert">Consumer Services; the names, home addresses, telephone numbers,</u>
  499  <u class="Insert">dates of birth, and places of employment of the spouses and</u>
  500  <u class="Insert">children of current and former private investigators licensed by</u>
  501  <u class="Insert">the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services; and the</u>
  502  <u class="Insert">names and locations of schools and day care facilities attended</u>
  503  <u class="Insert">by the children of current and former private investigators</u>
  504  <u class="Insert">licensed by the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services</u>
  505  <u class="Insert">be made exempt from s. 119.07(1), Florida Statutes, and s.</u>
  506  <u class="Insert">24(a), Article I of the State Constitution. Private</u>
  507  <u class="Insert">investigators routinely engage in sensitive work that may</u>
  508  <u class="Insert">involve uncovering fraud, locating missing persons, or assisting</u>
  509  <u class="Insert">in criminal and civil matters. In the course of their duties,</u>
  510  <u class="Insert">private investigators often interact with individuals who have</u>
  511  <u class="Insert">strong motives to retaliate or cause harm. Public access to a</u>
  512  <u class="Insert">private investigatorâs home address or personal information</u>
  513  <u class="Insert">could expose private investigators and their families to</u>
  514  <u class="Insert">threats, harassment, stalking, or physical violence. Protecting</u>
  515  <u class="Insert">this information does not diminish transparency or</u>
  516  <u class="Insert">accountability in government but instead balances the publicâs</u>
  517  <u class="Insert">right to access records with this stateâs compelling interest in</u>
  518  <u class="Insert">safeguarding the personal safety of those who provide critical</u>
  519  <u class="Insert">private investigative services. Therefore, exempting such</u>
  520  <u class="Insert">information from public records requirements is a reasonable and</u>
  521  <u class="Insert">necessary measure to ensure the security and privacy of private</u>
  522  <u class="Insert">investigators and their families while preserving the integrity</u>
  523  <u class="Insert">of this stateâs public records system.</u>
  524         Section 3.âThis act shall take effect July 1, 2026.
