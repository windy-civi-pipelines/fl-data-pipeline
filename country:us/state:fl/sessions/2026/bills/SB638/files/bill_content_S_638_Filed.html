   43  administration, any committee, and the unit owners, and a
   44  recording of all such meetings that are conducted by video
   45  conference. If there are approved minutes for a meeting held by
   46  video conference, recordings of meetings that are conducted by
   47  video conference must be maintained for at least 1 year after
   48  the date the video recording is posted as required under

   71  such disclosure was made with a knowing or intentional disregard
   72  of the protected nature of such information.

   85  to create or maintain such records, with the intent of causing
