    1                        A bill to be entitled                      
    2         An act relating to domestic violence centers; amending

    6         prohibiting the removal of a child from certain

   13         39.522, F.S.; providing that a child and his or her

   17         effective date.
   18          
   19  Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Florida:
   20  
   21         Section 1.âParagraph (o) of subsection (2) and paragraph
   22  (b) of subsection (3) of section 39.521, Florida Statutes, are
   23  amended to read:
   24         39.521âDisposition hearings; powers of disposition.â
   25         (2)âThe family functioning assessment must provide the
   26  court with the following documented information:
   27         (o)âIf the child has been removed from the home and will be
   28  remaining with a relative, parent, or other adult approved by
   29  the court, a home study report concerning the proposed placement
   30  shall be provided to the court. Before recommending to the court
   31  any out-of-home placement for a child other than placement in a
   32  licensed shelter or foster home, the department shall conduct a
   33  study of the home of the proposed legal custodians, which must
   34  include, at a minimum:
   35         1.âAn interview with the proposed legal custodians to
   36  assess their ongoing commitment and ability to care for the
   37  child.
   38         2.âRecords checks through the State Automated Child Welfare
   39  Information System (SACWIS), and local and statewide criminal
   40  and juvenile records checks through the Department of Law
   41  Enforcement, on all household members 12 years of age or older.
   42  In addition, the fingerprints of any household members who are
   43  18 years of age or older may be submitted to the Department of
   44  Law Enforcement for processing and forwarding to the Federal
   45  Bureau of Investigation for state and national criminal history
   46  information. The department has the discretion to request State
   47  Automated Child Welfare Information System (SACWIS) and local,
   48  statewide, and national criminal history checks and
   49  fingerprinting of any other visitor to the home who is made
   50  known to the department. Out-of-state criminal records checks
   51  must be initiated for any individual who has resided in a state
   52  other than Florida if that stateâs laws allow the release of
   53  these records. The out-of-state criminal records must be filed
   54  with the court within 5 days after receipt by the department or
   55  its agent.
   56         3.âAn assessment of the physical environment of the home.
   57         4.âA determination of the financial security of the
   58  proposed legal custodians.
   59         5.âA determination of suitable child care arrangements if
   60  the proposed legal custodians are employed outside of the home.
   61         6.âDocumentation of counseling and information provided to
   62  the proposed legal custodians regarding the dependency process
   63  and possible outcomes.
   64         7.âDocumentation that information regarding support
   65  services available in the community has been provided to the
   66  proposed legal custodians.
   67         8.âThe reasonable preference of the child, if the court
   68  deems the child to be of sufficient intelligence, understanding,
   69  and experience to express a preference.
   70  
   71  The department may not place the child or continue the placement
   72  of the child in a home under shelter or postdisposition
   73  placement if the results of the home study are unfavorable,
   74  unless the court finds that this placement is in the childâs
   75  best interest. <u class="Insert">The results of a home study may not be deemed</u>
   76  <u class="Insert">unfavorable solely due to the potential custodian </u><u class="Insert">temporarily</u>
   77  <u class="Insert">residing in a certified domestic violence center. A</u><u class="Insert"> child may</u>
   78  <u class="Insert">not be removed from such placement due to the custodian and</u>
   79  <u class="Insert">child temporarily residing in a certified domestic violence</u>
   80  <u class="Insert">center instead of the physical environment that was assessed in</u>
   81  <u class="Insert">the home study if the custodian</u><u class="Insert"> notifies the department within</u>
   82  <u class="Insert">24 </u><u class="Insert">hours </u><u class="Insert">after taking </u><u class="Insert">shelter</u><u class="Insert"> in the domestic violence center</u>
   83  <u class="Insert">and the domestic violence center</u><u class="Insert"> administration affirms in an</u>
   84  <u class="Insert">affidavit that the placement remains appropriate and protective.</u>
   85  
   86  Any other relevant and material evidence, including other
   87  written or oral reports, may be received by the court in its
   88  effort to determine the action to be taken with regard to the
   89  child and may be relied upon to the extent of its probative
   90  value, even though not competent in an adjudicatory hearing.
   91  Except as otherwise specifically provided, nothing in this
   92  section prohibits the publication of proceedings in a hearing.
   93         (3)âWhen any child is adjudicated by a court to be
   94  dependent, the court shall determine the appropriate placement
   95  for the child as follows:
   96         (b)âIf there is a parent with whom the child was not
   97  residing at the time the events or conditions arose that brought
   98  the child within the jurisdiction of the court who desires to
   99  assume custody of the child, the court shall place the child
  100  with that parent upon completion of a home study, unless the
  101  court finds that such placement would endanger the safety, well
  102  being, or physical, mental, or emotional health of the child.
  103  <u class="Insert">The court may not find that such placement would endanger the</u>
  104  <u class="Insert">safety, well-being, or physical, mental, or emotional health of</u>
  105  <u class="Insert">the child</u><u class="Insert"> solely due to the parent temporarily</u><u class="Insert"> residing in a</u>
  106  <u class="Insert">certified domestic violence center</u><u class="Insert">.</u> Any party with knowledge of
  107  the facts may present to the court evidence regarding whether
  108  the placement will endanger the safety, well-being, or physical,
  109  mental, or emotional health of the child.
  110         <u class="Insert">1.</u>âIf the court places the child with such parent, it may
  111  do either of the following:
  112         <u class="Insert">a.</u><s class="Remove">1.</s>âOrder that the parent assume sole custodial
  113  responsibilities for the child. The court may also provide for
  114  reasonable visitation by the noncustodial parent. The court may
  115  then terminate its jurisdiction over the child.
  116         <u class="Insert">b.</u><s class="Remove">2.</s>âOrder that the parent assume custody subject to the
  117  jurisdiction of the circuit court hearing dependency matters.
  118  The court may order that reunification services be provided to
  119  the parent from whom the child has been removed, that services
  120  be provided solely to the parent who is assuming physical
  121  custody in order to allow that parent to retain later custody
  122  without court jurisdiction, or that services be provided to both
  123  parents, in which case the court shall determine at every review
  124  hearing which parent, if either, shall have custody of the
  125  child. The standard for changing custody of the child from one
  126  parent to another or to a relative or another adult approved by
  127  the court shall be the best interest of the child.
  128         <u class="Insert">2.â</u><u class="Insert">The court may not </u><u class="Insert">remove the child from placement with</u>
  129  <u class="Insert">the parent</u><u class="Insert"> </u><u class="Insert">due to the parent</u><u class="Insert"> and the child temporarily residing</u>
  130  <u class="Insert">in a certified domestic violence center </u><u class="Insert">instead of the physical</u>
  131  <u class="Insert">environment that was assessed in the home study </u><u class="Insert">if the</u><u class="Insert"> parent</u>
  132  <u class="Insert">notifies the department within 24 hours after taking shelter in</u>
  133  <u class="Insert">the domestic violence center and the domestic violence center</u>
  134  <u class="Insert">administration affirms in an affidavit that the placement</u>
  135  <u class="Insert">remains appropriate and protective</u><u class="Insert">.</u>
  136  
  137  Protective supervision continues until the court terminates it
  138  or until the child reaches the age of 18, whichever date is
  139  first. Protective supervision shall be terminated by the court
  140  whenever the court determines that permanency has been achieved
  141  for the child, whether with a parent, another relative, or a
  142  legal custodian, and that protective supervision is no longer
  143  needed. The termination of supervision may be with or without
  144  retaining jurisdiction, at the courtâs discretion, and shall in
  145  either case be considered a permanency option for the child. The
  146  order terminating supervision by the department shall set forth
  147  the powers of the custodian of the child and shall include the
  148  powers ordinarily granted to a guardian of the person of a minor
  149  unless otherwise specified. Upon the courtâs termination of
  150  supervision by the department, no further judicial reviews are
  151  required, so long as permanency has been established for the
  152  child.
  153         Section 2.âParagraph (b) of subsection (3) of section
  154  39.522, Florida Statutes, is amended to read:
  155         39.522âPostdisposition change of custody.â
  156         (3)
  157         (b)1.âIn a hearing on the change of physical custody under
  158  this section, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that it is
  159  in the childâs best interest to remain permanently in his or her
  160  current physical placement if:
  161         a.âThe child has been in the same safe and stable placement
  162  for 9 consecutive months or more;
  163         b.âReunification is not a permanency option for the child;
  164         c.âThe caregiver is able, willing, and eligible for
  165  consideration as an adoptive parent or permanent custodian for
  166  the child;
  167         d.âThe caregiver is not requesting the change in physical
  168  placement; and
  169         e.âThe change in physical placement being sought is not to
  170  reunify the child with his or her parent or sibling or
  171  transition the child from a safe and stable nonrelative
  172  caregiver to a safe and stable relative caregiver.
  173         2.âIn order to rebut the presumption established in this
  174  paragraph, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on the
  175  change in physical custody to determine if the change in
  176  placement is in the best interest of the child. As part of the
  177  evidentiary hearing, the court must consider competent and
  178  substantial evidence and testimony related to the factors
  179  enumerated in s. 39.01375 and any other evidence deemed relevant
  180  to a determination of placement, including evidence from a
  181  court-selected neutral and independent licensed professional
  182  with expertise in the science and research of child-parent
  183  bonding.
  184         3.âThis presumption may not be rebutted solely by the
  185  expressed wishes of a biological parent, a biological relative,
  186  or a caregiver of a sibling of the child.
  187         <u class="Insert">4.âA child temporarily residing with his or her caregiver</u>
  188  <u class="Insert">in a certified domestic violence center does not rebut the</u>
  189  <u class="Insert">presumption established in this paragraph if the caregiver</u>
  190  <u class="Insert">notifies the department within 24 hours after taking shelter in</u>
  191  <u class="Insert">the domestic violence center and the domestic violence center</u>
  192  <u class="Insert">administration affirms in an affidavit that the placement</u>
  193  <u class="Insert">remains appropriate and protective</u><u class="Insert">.</u>
  194         Section 3.âThis act shall take effect July 1, 2026.
