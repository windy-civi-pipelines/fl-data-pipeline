55 care lead agencies have implemented the suggestions of the
56 organizations based on the meetings required in paragraphs (a)
57 and (b).
58 Section 2. Subsection (5) of section 409.145, Florida
59 Statutes, is renumbered as subsection (6), paragraph (b) of

76 2. Each caregiver shall use the reasonable and prudent
77 parent standard in determining whether to give permission for a
78 child living in out-of-home care to participate in
79 extracurricular, enrichment, or social activities. When using
80 the reasonable and prudent parent standard, the caregiver must
81 consider:
82 a. The child's age, maturity, and developmental level to
83 maintain the overall health and safety of the child.
84 b. The potential risk factors and the appropriateness of
85 the extracurricular, enrichment, or social activity.
86 c. The best interest of the child, based on information
87 known by the caregiver.
88 d. The importance of encouraging the child's emotional and
89 developmental growth.
90 e. The importance of providing the child with the most
91 family-like living experience possible.

99 also encouraged to offer the opportunity to earn money through
100 chores to a child placed in his or her care and to help such

106 the child's allowance as a form of punishment. A child is not
107 expected to use his or her allowance to purchase personal
