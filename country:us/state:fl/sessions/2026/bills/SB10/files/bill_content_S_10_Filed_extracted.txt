policies; providing 8 legislative intent that certain liens be waived; 9 providing a limitation on the payment of compensation 10 and attorney fees; providing an effective date. 11 12 WHEREAS, at 11:45 a.m. on August 6, 2007, Broward County 13 Sheriffâs Deputy Maury Hernandez, then 28 years of age, was 14 operating a vehicle assigned to him by the sheriffâs office and 15 was within its jurisdiction when he observed David Maldonado, 16 then 23 years of age, the operator of a motorcycle, fail to stop 17 at three traffic signals on Pembroke Road, and 18 WHEREAS, Deputy Hernandez engaged his lights and stopped 19 Mr. Maldonado at a location within the 3700 block of Pembroke 20 Road, where he parked and got out of his vehicle, approached Mr. 21 Maldonado, identified himself as a deputy sheriff, and displayed 22 his badge, and 23 WHEREAS, Mr. Maldonado falsely identified himself as a 24 police officer from Opa-locka and, when asked to produce 25 identification, dropped his motorcycle, pushed Deputy Hernandez, 26 and fled on foot, at which time Deputy Hernandez gave chase, 27 also on foot, and 28 WHEREAS, during the chase, Mr. Maldonado suddenly turned 29 around and fired two rounds from a .45 caliber handgun, striking 30 Deputy Hernandez in the head, and 31 WHEREAS, although Deputy Hernandez was critically wounded, 32 he miraculously survived the shooting and was rushed to Memorial 33 Regional Hospital in Hollywood, where he was in a coma and was 34 placed on life support, and 35 WHEREAS, shortly after the shooting, Mr. Maldonado was 36 apprehended by Hollywood police in a nearby condominium complex 37 where he had attempted a carjacking, and 38 WHEREAS, Mr. Maldonado was ultimately charged and convicted 39 of attempted murder in the first degree and numerous probation 40 violations and is currently serving a life sentence, and 41 WHEREAS, four months before the shooting, on April 18, 42 2007, Mr. Maldonado, a habitual traffic offender with a history 43 of multiple drug offenses and an illegal concealed weapon 44 conviction, pled no contest to felony traffic charges and was 45 placed on probation for 24 months, and 46 WHEREAS, the Department of Correctionsâ records document 47 that in April and May of 2007, before the shooting of Deputy 48 Hernandez, Mr. Maldonado twice admitted to his probation 49 officers that he illegally possessed a firearm in violation of 50 Florida law, the departmentâs zero-tolerance policy, and the 51 conditions of his probation supervision, but his probation 52 officers simply warned him that he could not possess a weapon 53 and did not report the violations to the state attorney or to 54 the presiding circuit judge, and 55 WHEREAS, on June 28, 2007, Mr. Maldonado admitted a third 56 probation violation for buying and using illegal drugs in 57 violation of s. 948.03, Florida Statutes, which prohibits 58 probationers from possessing drugs or narcotics unless 59 prescribed by a physician, and violating the conditions of his 60 probation, but the probation officer failed to report the 61 violation, and 62 WHEREAS, under former s. 948.03, Florida Statutes (now s. 63 790.23, Florida Statutes), Mr. Maldonado was prohibited from 64 possessing, carrying, or owning any firearm unless authorized by 65 the court, and 66 WHEREAS, s. 944.09, Florida Statutes, requires the 67 Department of Corrections to supervise probationers, stay 68 informed about the probationersâ conduct, and cooperate with 69 circuit courts exercising criminal jurisdiction over 70 probationers, and 71 WHEREAS, rule 33-302.1031, Florida Administrative Code, 72 implements s. 944.09, Florida Statutes, and provides that 73 probation officers under the authority of the Department of 74 Corrections are responsible for supervision and control of 75 offenders, including enforcing conditions of supervision, 76 conducting investigations, and initiating arrest of offenders 77 under their supervision, as appropriate, with or without a 78 warrant, and 79 WHEREAS, rule 33-302.1031, Florida Administrative Code, 80 further provides that a probation officer must notify the 81 sentencing or releasing authority whenever the officer has 82 reasonable grounds to believe that a willful violation of any 83 condition of supervision has occurred, and 84 WHEREAS, in 2003, the Department of Corrections established 85 a zero-tolerance policy requiring probation officers to report 86 all technical violations committed by offenders on community 87 control to the court, and the department extended this policy in 88 2004 to all offenders under community supervision in response to 89 several cases in which supervised offenders committed murders, 90 and 91 WHEREAS, the Department of Corrections modified its zero 92 tolerance policy in August 2007 to require probation officers to 93 report only willful violations, such as the violations committed 94 by Mr. Maldonado, which are purposely committed by an offender 95 or over which the offender had control, and 96 WHEREAS, shortly after the shooting, and while Deputy 97 Hernandez remained hospitalized and struggling for his life, a 98 Department of Correctionsâ spokesperson defended the probation 99 officersâ actions as âerrors in judgment,â stating that 100 âeverything was done by the book,â the department had counseled 101 the probation officer to âkeep his case notes and records 102 complete and up to date,â and the probation officer had the 103 support of, and remained employed by, the department despite his 104 clear violations of the departmentâs zero-tolerance policy, and 105 WHEREAS, by virtue of its zero-tolerance policy in effect 106 at the time of Deputy Hernandezâs shooting, the Department of 107 Corrections had a nondiscretionary duty to timely report Mr. 108 Maldonadoâs violations of law and the conditions of his 109 probation to the state attorneyâs office and the presiding 110 circuit judge, but failed to act on his repeated probation 111 violations, and 112 WHEREAS, not only did the Department of Corrections fail to 113 report Mr. Maldonadoâs illegal possession of a firearm, but his 114 probation file showed the use of illegal drugs and was replete 115 with omissions and false statements, including claims that Mr. 116 Maldonado was a United States Marine headed to Iraq and worked 117 as an armed security guard, even though it is illegal for felons 118 and probationers to use drugs or possess a weapon, and 119 WHEREAS, Mr. Maldonadoâs 70-page probation file contained 120 no evidence that the probation officers ever contacted his 121 alleged employers to confirm his job status or made sure he had 122 given up his weapons, and 123 WHEREAS, the Broward County Sheriffâs investigation of 124 Deputy Hernandezâs shooting concluded that, had the Department 125 of Corrections brought the repeated violations of Mr. 126 Maldonadoâs probation to the attention of the state attorney and 127 presiding circuit judge, Mr. Maldonado would have been in jail 128 at the time of the shooting, and 129 WHEREAS, the state attorneyâs office for the Seventeenth 130 Judicial Circuit, in and for Broward County, concurred that Mr. 131 Maldonadoâs violations were âseriousâ and should have been 132 reported by the Department of Corrections to the state attorney 133 and the presiding circuit judge and, had Mr. Maldonadoâs 134 violations been reported, he would have been jailed without bail 135 and would not have been on the streets when he shot Deputy 136 Hernandez, and 137 WHEREAS, after the shooting, the Department of Corrections 138 announced that Mr. Maldonadoâs probation file had been turned 139 over to the departmentâs Office of Inspector General for review, 140 but no report or any record of a department review exist, nor to 141 this day has the department explained why Mr. Maldonadoâs 142 multiple violations of law, department policy, and the terms of 143 his probation were not enforced and reported to the state 144 attorney and presiding circuit judge as required by law, and 145 WHEREAS, a lawsuit was filed on behalf of Deputy Hernandez 146 in the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit which sought relief under s. 147 768.28, Florida Statutes, but was dismissed by the trial court 148 on January 27, 2016, the court holding that under existing 149 Florida case law, the Department of Corrections owed no specific 150 or special legal duty of care to Deputy Hernandez, who is 151 without a legal or administrative remedy for his claim, and 152 WHEREAS, despite the courtâs ruling that Deputy Hernandez 153 is without a legal remedy, Florida legislative precedent dating 154 back to 1831, as stated in the Legislative Claim Bill Manual 155 (2022), defines a claim bill to be âa means by which an injured 156 party may recover damages even though the public officer or 157 agency involved may be immune from suit,â and 158 WHEREAS, the Florida Supreme Court and appellate courts 159 acknowledge relief for âequitable claims filed without an 160 underlying excess judgmentâ or settlement, and the far-reaching 161 circumstances under which the Legislature may extend equitable 162 relief for an injured party even though the public officer or 163 agency may be immune from suit, and 164 WHEREAS, these cases include Gamble v. Wells, 450 So.2d 850 165 (Fla. 1984), holding that any claim bill, whether based on an 166 existing judgment, a settlement, or an equitable claim, is an 167 âact of legislative graceâ and âa voluntary recognition of its 168 moral obligation by the legislature,â and is âfirmly entrenched 169 in legislative discretionâ; Searcy Denney, et al. vs. State of 170 Fla., 209 So.3d 1181 (Fla. 2017), citing Noel v. Schlesinger, 171 P.A., 984 So.2d 1265 (Fla. 4th DCA 2008) and Gamble v. Wells, 172 supra; Dickinson v. Bradley, 298 So.2d 352 (Fla. 1974), in which 173 the Florida Supreme Court stated that the âpurposeâ of any 174 legislative relief act is to âdischarge the stateâs moral 175 obligation to any individual or entity whom or which the 176 legislature recognizes as being entitled to suchâ; and Jetton v. 177 Jacksonville Electric Authority, 399 So.2d 396, 397 (Fla. 1st 178 DCA 1981), holding that while the Legislature has placed limits 179 on recovery, âclaimants remain free to seek legislative relief 180 bills, as they did during days of complete sovereign immunity,â 181 and 182 WHEREAS, the facts as set forth herein establish that the 183 Department of Corrections failed to follow state law, 184 regulations, and policies and take action to prevent a convicted 185 felon on probation from possessing a weapon; to enforce numerous 186 other serious and willful probation violations committed by a 187 probationer who falsely claimed to be a United States Marine; 188 and to supervise, investigate, enforce, and report any of these 189 probation violations to the state attorney and presiding circuit 190 judge as required by law, and 191 WHEREAS, this claim bill is supported by the Broward County 192 Sheriffâs Office, the Florida Police Benevolent Association, and 193 the International Union of Police Associations, and 194 WHEREAS, given the unique and tragic circumstances of this 195 case, including the attempted murder and permanent disability of 196 a sworn Florida police officer who was critically and 197 permanently injured in the line of duty, Deputy Hernandez is 198 deserving of legislative grace and the Legislatureâs exercise of 199 its exclusive authority to appropriate funds to compensate him 200 for his injuries and economic damages, and 201 WHEREAS, Deputy Hernandezâs injuries include permanent 202 brain injuries and impairment, including hemiparesis to the 203 entire left side of his body, severe motor and sensory nerve 204 damage, spasticity, numbness and muscle weakness, impaired 205 walking and balance, cognitive impairment, hydrocephalus treated 206 with the insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt that drains 207 excess cerebrospinal fluid from his brainâs ventricles into his 208 abdomen, a silicone plate that covers a third of his skull, and 209 fragments of the .45 caliber bullet which remain permanently 210 lodged in his brain, and 211 WHEREAS, Deputy Hernandez has endured multiple surgeries, 212 including a tracheostomy, multiple brain surgeries, 213 hydrocephalus shunt surgery, and months of inpatient hospital 214 care, followed by a year of daylong physical, occupational, 215 speech, visual, cognitive, and psychological therapy, and 216 WHEREAS, Deputy Hernandez continued to receive various 217 therapies and medical care on a daily basis for more than 3 218 years until his insurance provider discontinued payments to 219 health care providers, and 220 WHEREAS, to regain and restore maximum medical stability, 221 Deputy Hernandez needs to resume the medical care and 222 professional therapy treatments he no longer receives, but he is 223 without financial resources to do so, and 224 WHEREAS, at the time of his injury, Deputy Hernandez was 225 earning an annual salary of approximately $60,000, in addition 226 to medical and retirement benefits, and 227 WHEREAS, Deputy Hernandez attempted to return to work at 228 the Broward County Sheriffâs Office but was unable to perform to 229 minimum standards, and 230 WHEREAS, Deputy Hernandez has been declared by his 231

comprehensive care plan 239 company with more than 35 years of experience providing medical 240 case management, vocational services, and rehabilitative 241 services to individuals and insurance companies, in consultation 242 with and reliance upon the opinions of Deputy Hernandezâs 243 physicians, assessed his future medical and life care needs, 244 which will amount to $2,243,981.97, and 245 WHEREAS, the study found that Deputy Hernandezâs wage 246 losses and earning capacity amount to $3,353,924.70 had he 247 remained in law enforcement, and 248 WHEREAS, a lien has been filed against Deputy Hernandez in 249 the amount of $1,133,448.06 by the workersâ compensation insurer 250 that paid benefits for past medical and wage-related expenses, 251 and 252 WHEREAS, Deputy
