26 (2) If the Department of Commerce finds that the
27 individual has failed without good cause to apply for available
28 suitable work, to contact the required number of prospective
29 employers per week for any week of unemployment claimed in a
30 benefit year in accordance with s. 443.091, to appear on three
31 or more occasions for a scheduled job interview without
32 notifying the prospective employer of the need to cancel or
33 reschedule the interview, to accept suitable work when offered
34 to him or her, to or return to the individual's customary self-
35 employment when directed by the department, or to return to
36 employment when recalled to work by the individual's employer
37 after a temporary layoff, the disqualification continues for the
38 full period of unemployment next ensuing after he or she failed
39 without good cause to apply for available suitable work, to
40 appear on three or more occasions for a scheduled job interview
41 without notification, to accept suitable work, to or return to
42 his or her customary self-employment, or to return to his or her
43 employment after a temporary layoff, and until the individual
44 has earned income of at least 17 times his or her weekly benefit
45 amount. The department shall by rule adopt criteria to implement
46 this subsection, including criteria for determining the

49 claimant's unemployment in determining the suitability of work

51 available work. Further, after an individual has received 25
52 weeks of benefits in a single year, suitable work is a job that
53 pays the minimum wage and is 120 percent or more of the weekly
54 benefit amount the individual is drawing.
55 (a) In determining whether or not any work is suitable for
56 an individual, the department shall consider the degree of risk
57 to the individual's health, safety, and morals; the individual's
58 physical fitness, prior training, experience, prior earnings,
59 length of unemployment, and prospects for securing local work in
60 his or her customary occupation; and the distance of the
61 available work from his or her residence.
62 (b) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter,
63 work is not deemed suitable and benefits may not be denied to
64 any otherwise eligible individual for refusing to accept new
65 work under any of the following conditions:
66 1. The position offered is vacant due directly to a
67 strike, lockout, or other labor dispute.
68 2. The wages, hours, or other conditions of the work
69 offered are substantially less favorable to the individual than
70 those prevailing for similar work in the locality.
71 3. As a condition of being employed, the individual is
72 required to join a company union or to resign from or refrain
73 from joining any bona fide labor organization.
74 (c) If the department finds that an individual was
75 rejected for offered employment as the direct result of a

79 Section 3. Section 443.1112, Florida Statutes, is created
80 to read:
81 443.1112 Verification of reemployment assistance benefit
82 eligibility; detection of fraud.—
83 (1) The Department of Commerce must verify the identity of
84 each claimant who applies for reemployment assistance benefits
85 before paying any benefits to the claimant.
86 (2) For the initial claim for benefits made by a claimant
87 and as necessary to verify a claimant's eligibility for
88 benefits, the department must cross-check the information
89 contained in the claim with information in the database of the
90 Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements Program
91 established by the United States Bureau of Citizenship and
92 Immigration Services.
93 (3) For every 2 weeks that a claimant makes a claim for
94 benefits, including the initial claim for benefits, to verify a
95 claimant's eligibility for benefits, the department must cross-
96 check the information contained in the claim to ensure that the
97 claimant is:
98 (a) Living.
99 (b) Not incarcerated.
100 (c) Not already employed.

101 (4) The department shall do all of the following:
102 (a) Investigate any claim associated with a mailing
103 address, a bank account, an e-mail address, a telephone number,
104 or an Internet protocol address that is also associated with
105 another existing claim for reemployment assistance benefits in
106 this state or another state and verify that the claim in this
107 state is legitimate and not fraudulent before paying any
108 benefits for the claim.
109 (b) Examine each claim filed from a foreign Internet
110 protocol address before paying any benefits for the claim.
111 (c) Work with the United States Department of Labor, the
112 United States Department of Justice, other state workforce
113 agencies, the Department of Law Enforcement, the state
114 attorneys, or the Office of the Statewide Prosecutor to share
115 information related to fraudulent claims or attempted fraudulent
116 claims to the extent feasible for further investigation and
117 proceedings brought under this chapter.
118 (d) Maintain a web page through which an individual or an
119 employer may report known or suspected violations of this
120 chapter, including identity theft or fraud. Each year, the
121 department shall notify employers in this state of the web page
122 for reporting violations.
123 (e) Each year, make available on its website a report
124 identifying for the prior year the number of fraudulent
125 reemployment assistance claims identified, the number of claims
