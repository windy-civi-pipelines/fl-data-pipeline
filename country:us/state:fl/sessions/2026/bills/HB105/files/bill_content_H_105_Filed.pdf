30 enforcement of local government and special district
31 regulations.
32 (b) The Legislature further finds that arbitrary or

38 uniform standard for regulatory enforcement and create an
39 investigative process and certain legal remedies for a person or
40 business entity subject to an enforcement action under this

43 thereof, may not initiate or threaten to initiate any
44 enforcement action that is determined to be arbitrary or
45 unreasonable by a court of competent jurisdiction. For purposes
46 of this section, an "enforcement action" means any decision,
47 determination, demand, inspection, citation, order, denial,
