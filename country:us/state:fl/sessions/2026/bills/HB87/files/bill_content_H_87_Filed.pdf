61 food and nonalcoholic beverages during the first 120-day
62 operating period and the first 12-month operating period
63 thereafter. Subsequent audit timeframes must be based upon the
64 audit percentage established by the most recent audit and

76 authorize public food service establishments licensed under this
77 subparagraph to sell a bottle of distilled spirits sealed by a
78 manufacturer. Any sale or delivery of malt beverages must comply
79 with the container size, labeling, and filling requirements
80 imposed under s. 563.06. Any delivery of an alcoholic beverage
81 under this subparagraph must comply with s. 561.57. An alcoholic
82 beverage drink prepared by the vendor and sold or delivered for
83 consumption off the premises must be placed in a container
84 securely sealed by the licensee or its employees with an
85 unbroken seal that prevents the beverage from being immediately
86 consumed before removal from the premises. Such alcoholic
87 beverage also must be placed in a bag or other container that is
88 secured in such a manner that it is visibly apparent if the
89 container has been subsequently opened or tampered with, and a
90 dated receipt for the alcoholic beverage and food must be
91 provided by the licensee and attached to the bag or container.
92 If transported in a motor vehicle, an alcoholic beverage that is
93 not in a container sealed by the manufacturer must be placed in
94 a locked compartment, a locked trunk, or the area behind the
95 last upright seat of a motor vehicle. It is a violation of the
96 prohibition in s. 562.11 to allow any person under the age of 21
97 to deliver alcoholic beverages on behalf of a vendor. The vendor
98 or the agent or employee of the vendor must verify the age of
99 the person making the delivery of the alcoholic beverage before
100 allowing any person to take possession of an alcoholic beverage

104 special law may not operate as a package store and may not sell
105 intoxicating beverages under such license after the hours of
106 serving or consumption of food have elapsed. Failure by a
107 licensee to meet the required percentage of food and
108 nonalcoholic beverage gross revenues during the covered
109 operating period shall result in revocation of the license or
110 denial of the pending license application. A licensee whose
111 license is revoked or an applicant whose pending application is
112 denied, or any person required to qualify on the special license
113 application, is ineligible to have any interest in a subsequent
114 application for such a license for a period of 120 days after
115 the date of the final denial or revocation;

134 subparagraph may not store any alcoholic beverages to be sold or
135 served at a catered event. Any alcoholic beverages purchased by
136 a licensee under this subparagraph for a catered event that are
137 not used at that event must remain with the customer; provided
138 that if the vendor accepts unopened alcoholic beverages, the
139 licensee may return such alcoholic beverages to the vendor for a
140 credit or reimbursement. Regardless of the county or counties in

227 accommodation, under the general law may not be moved to a new
228 location, such license being valid only on the premises of such

230 hotels, motels, motor courts, or restaurants under the general
231 law and held by such hotels, motels, motor courts, or
232 restaurants on May 24, 1947, shall be counted in the quota

235 only to the owner of the hotel, motel, or motor court or, in the
236 event the hotel, motel, or motor court is leased, to the lessee
237 of the hotel, motel, or motor court; and the license shall
238 remain in the name of the owner or lessee so long as the license
239 is in existence. Any special license now in existence heretofore
240 issued under this law cannot be renewed except in the name of
241 the owner of the hotel, motel, motor court, or restaurant or, in
242 the event the hotel, motel, motor court, or restaurant is
