202 action, an order or judgment may be entered awarding such
203 temporary or permanent injunction as may be deemed proper. Such

213 the court may deem reasonably necessary to prevent violations of
214 the law or injury to the public through, or by means of, the use
215 of such property and business. The receiver, when so appointed
216 and qualified, shall have such powers and duties as to custody,
217 collection, administration, winding up, and liquidation of such
218 property and business as is, from time to time, conferred upon
219 him or her by the court. In any such action, the court may issue
220 an order staying all pending civil actions and the court, in its
221 discretion, may require that all civil actions be assigned to
222 the circuit court judge who appointed the receiver.
223 (7) The provisions and penalties set forth in this section
224 are in addition to any other civil, administrative, or criminal
225 action provided by law.
