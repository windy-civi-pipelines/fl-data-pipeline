685 necessary treatment and stabilization in the least restrictive
686 setting that can safely meet the child's needs.
687 2. Coordinates judicial oversight with clinical
688 assessment, case planning, and transition planning.

690 setting as acute symptoms resolve, while preserving the high-
691 acuity child's rights to education, visitation, and normalcy.

693 (a) "Community-based care lead agency" has the same
694 meaning as in s. 409.986(3).

877 39.523 Placement in out-of-home care.—
878 (1) LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND INTENT.—
879 (c) The Legislature also finds that the timely
880 identification of and therapeutic response to acute presentation
881 of symptoms indicative of trauma or high-acuity complex needs
882 can reduce adverse outcomes for a child, aid in the
883 identification of services to enhance initial placement
884 stability and of supports to caregivers, and reduce placement
885 disruption.
886 (d) It is the intent of the Legislature that whenever a
887 child is unable to safely remain at home with a parent, the most
888 appropriate available out-of-home placement must shall be chosen
889 after an assessment of the child's needs and the availability of
890 caregivers qualified to meet the child's needs, including
891 certain group or treatment settings that are appropriate for
892 addressing the needs of a high-acuity child.
893 (e) It is the intent of the Legislature that this section
894 applies to transitions between all out-of-home placements,
895 including, but not limited to, medical placements under s.

1201 operate as a coordinated community-based system of care which
1202 empowers all caregivers for children in foster care to provide
1203 quality parenting, including approving or disapproving a child's
1204 participation in activities based on the caregiver's assessment
1205 using the "reasonable and prudent parent" standard.
1206 (1) SYSTEM OF CARE.—The department shall develop,
1207 implement, and administer a coordinated community-based system
1208 of care for children who are found to be dependent and their
1209 families. This system of care must be directed toward the
1210 following goals:
1211 (h) Ensure that a child who has been designated as a high-
1212 acuity child after an assessment for such purpose has the most
1213 appropriate medical placement and necessary services, including
1214 transitions to more restrictive and less restrictive settings,
1215 to address the acute or chronic expression of the medical
1216 conditions that are the reason for the high-acuity designation.
1217 (2) REASONABLE AND PRUDENT PARENT STANDARD.—
1218 (a) Definitions.—As used in this subsection, the term:
1219 1. "Age-appropriate" means an activity or item that is
1220 generally accepted as suitable for a child of the same
1221 chronological age or level of maturity. Age appropriateness is
1222 based on the development of cognitive, emotional, physical, and
1223 behavioral capacity which is typical for an age or age group.
1224 2. "Caregiver" means a person with whom the child is
1225 placed in out-of-home care, or a designated official for a group

1226 care facility licensed by the department under s. 409.175.
1227 3. "High-acuity child" has the same meaning as in s.
1228 39.01.
1229 4.3. "Reasonable and prudent parent" standard means the
1230 standard of care used by a caregiver in determining whether to
1231 allow a child in his or her care to participate in
1232 extracurricular, enrichment, and social activities. This
1233 standard is characterized by careful and thoughtful parental
1234 decisionmaking that is intended to maintain a child's health,
1235 safety, and best interest while encouraging the child's
1236 emotional and developmental growth.
1237 (b) Application of standard of care.—
1238 1. Every child who comes into out-of-home care pursuant to
1239 this chapter is entitled to participate in age-appropriate
1240 extracurricular, enrichment, and social activities.
1241 2. Each caregiver shall use the reasonable and prudent
1242 parent standard in determining whether to give permission for a
1243 child living in out-of-home care to participate in
1244 extracurricular, enrichment, or social activities. When using
1245 the reasonable and prudent parent standard, the caregiver must
1246 consider:
1247 a. The child's age, maturity, and developmental level to
1248 maintain the overall health and safety of the child.
1249 b. The potential risk factors and the appropriateness of
1250 the extracurricular, enrichment, or social activity.

1251 c. The best interest of the child, based on information
1252 known by the caregiver.
1253 d. The importance of encouraging the child's emotional and
1254 developmental growth.
1255 e. The importance of providing the child with the most
1256 family-like living experience possible.
1257 f. The behavioral history of the child and the child's
1258 ability to safely participate in the proposed activity.
1259
1260 For a high-acuity child, the medical necessity of such child and
1261 the need for medical placement or transitions to more
1262 restrictive and less restrictive settings take priority over the
1263 reasonable and prudent parent standard until such time as the
1264 court determines that the acute or chronic expression of the
1265 medical conditions that are the reason for the high-acuity
1266 designation have been stabilized.
1267 Section 17. Paragraph (d) of subsection (2) of section
1268 409.166, Florida Statutes, is amended to read:
1269 409.166 Children within the child welfare system; adoption
1270 assistance program.—
1271 (2) DEFINITIONS.—As used in this section, the term:
1272 (d) "Difficult-to-place child" means:
1273 1. A child whose permanent custody has been awarded to the
1274 department or to a licensed child-placing agency;
1275 2. A child who has established significant emotional ties

1280 c. Physically or emotionally handicapped;
1281 d. A member of a racial group that is disproportionately

1283 e. A member of a sibling group of any age, provided two or
1284 more members of a sibling group remain together for purposes of
1285 adoption; or
1286 f. A high-acuity child as defined in s. 39.01; and
1287 3. Except when the child is being adopted by the child's
1288 foster parents or relative caregivers, a child for whom a
1289 reasonable but unsuccessful effort has been made to place the
1290 child without providing a maintenance subsidy.
1291 Section 18. Subsection (30) is added to section 409.906,
1292 Florida Statutes, to read:
1293 409.906 Optional Medicaid services.—Subject to specific
1294 appropriations, the agency may make payments for services which
1295 are optional to the state under Title XIX of the Social Security
1296 Act and are furnished by Medicaid providers to recipients who
1297 are determined to be eligible on the dates on which the services
1298 were provided. Any optional service that is provided shall be
1299 provided only when medically necessary and in accordance with
1300 state and federal law. Optional services rendered by providers

1301 in mobile units to Medicaid recipients may be restricted or
1302 prohibited by the agency. Nothing in this section shall be
1303 construed to prevent or limit the agency from adjusting fees,
1304 reimbursement rates, lengths of stay, number of visits, or
1305 number of services, or making any other adjustments necessary to
1306 comply with the availability of moneys and any limitations or
1307 directions provided for in the General Appropriations Act or
1308 chapter 216. If necessary to safeguard the state's systems of
1309 providing services to elderly and disabled persons and subject
1310 to the notice and review provisions of s. 216.177, the Governor
1311 may direct the Agency for Health Care Administration to amend
1312 the Medicaid state plan to delete the optional Medicaid service
1313 known as "Intermediate Care Facilities for the Developmentally
1314 Disabled." Optional services may include:
1315 (30) The agency may pay for a medical bed in a medical
1316 placement and any transitions to more restrictive and less
1317 restrictive settings that are required to appropriately serve a
1318 high-acuity child as defined in s. 39.01 to ensure that a child
1319 designated as a high-acuity child has the most appropriate
1320 placement and services necessary to address the acute or chronic
1321 expression of the medical conditions that are the reason for the
1322 high-acuity designation. The agency may seek federal approval if
1323 necessary to implement this subsection.
