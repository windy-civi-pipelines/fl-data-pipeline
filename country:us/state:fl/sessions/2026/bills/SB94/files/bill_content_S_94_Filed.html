       35-00392-26                                             202694__
    1                        A bill to be entitled                      
    2         An act relating to suicide prevention for active and
    3         former members of the United States Armed Forces, the
    4         National Guard, and their reserve components;
    5         providing legislative findings and intent; amending s.
    6         394.463, F.S.; requiring a facility conducting an
    7         involuntary examination to include in its report to
    8         the Baker Act Reporting Center whether the individual
    9         examined is an active or former member of the United
   10         States Armed Forces, the National Guard, or their
   11         reserve components; providing an effective date.
   12  
   13         WHEREAS, the Legislature finds the rate of suicide among
   14  Florida active duty members and veterans of the United States
   15  Armed Forces, the National Guard, and their reserve components
   16  remains alarmingly high when compared to that of civilians, and
   17         WHEREAS, according to the Office of Suicide Prevention,
   18  there were 34.7 suicides per 100,000 veterans compared to 17.1
   19  per 100,000 nonveterans reported in 2022, and
   20         WHEREAS, current reporting requirements under the Baker Act
   21  do not mandate the collection of data on whether individuals
   22  subject to involuntary examinations are active duty members or
   23  veterans of the United States Armed Forces, the National Guard,
   24  or their reserve components, and
   25         WHEREAS, without accurate reporting, the state lacks
   26  critical information needed to determine whether the Baker Act
   27  is being applied appropriately to active duty members and
   28  veterans of the United States Armed Forces, the National Guard,
   29  or their reserve components, and
   30         WHEREAS, the Legislature intends to strengthen oversight
   31  and accountability in the application of the Baker Act by
   32  requiring mandatory reporting to include identification of a
   33  patientâs military status to support improved policymaking,
   34  prevention strategies, and positive mental health outcomes, NOW,
   35  THEREFORE,
   36  
   37  Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Florida:
