Any candidate 164 seeking to qualify by the petition process in a special primary 165 election must shall obtain 25 percent of the signatures required 166 by s. 99.095. 167 (g)(d)âThe qualifying fees and party assessments of such 168 candidates as may qualify must shall be the same as collected 169 for the same office at the last previous primary for that 170 office.
