63 promoting a more sustainable pattern of development. The
64 Legislature intends to create blue ribbon projects, and to
65 provide a mechanism by which local governments shall implement
66 those projects within their boundaries, in order to promote the
67 goals of preserving natural areas, encouraging agricultural land
68 uses and rural land stewardship, protecting critical ecological
69 systems, expanding wildlife corridors, and providing more
70 compact mixed-use developments designed for long-term viability.
71 (2) DEFINITIONS.—As used in this section, the term:
72 (a) "Applicant" means the owner of land on which a blue
73 ribbon project is proposed.

87 creates walkable, mixed-use, human-centered places.

HB 299 2026
251 requirements of this section must be administratively approved
252 without further action by the local government or any quasi-
253 judicial or administrative reviewing body. Local government
254 review of a project is limited to review for compliance with
255 this section. If the local government fails to provide written

257 of the application, or within 30 days after the applicant files
258 amended application documents that are responsive to initial
259 local government review, the application is automatically
260 approved. At any point after the local government's initial 60-
261 day review period, the applicant may request a final
262 determination by the local government, and the local government
263 must provide the determination within 7 days after receipt of
264 such request. If the local government fails to provide the
265 determination within the 7-day period, the application is
266 automatically approved.
267 (c) Applicants may hire private companies to conduct plan
268 reviews and building inspections pursuant to s. 553.791.
269 (d) If a blue ribbon project is approved, the applicant

271 circulation in the area in which the land is located. The notice
272 must include the local government order number, if any; the
273 section, township, and range in which the land is located; and a
274 description of the project. The notice must be published within
275 14 days after the approval is issued.

276 (e) After a blue ribbon project has been reviewed and
277 approved, the applicant must record the blue ribbon plan in the
278 public records of the county in which the project property is
279 located, and the plan shall run with title to the land. The
280 applicant may not amend the recorded plan without undergoing
281 local government review of the plan amendment in accordance with
282 paragraph (b). Local government review of a plan amendment is
283 limited to the portions of the plan which are being revised.
284 (7) APPEAL PROCEDURE.—
285 (a) If a local government denies an application for a blue
286 ribbon project, the applicant may appeal the decision by filing
287 a written petition with the Department of Commerce within 21
288 days after the date on which the applicant receives the local
289 government's written notice of application denial. The applicant
290 shall provide a copy of the notice of appeal to the local
291 government.
292 (b) Any person whose substantial interests are or may be
293 affected by the local government's approval of a blue ribbon
294 project may request an administrative hearing by filing a
295 written petition with the Department of Commerce pursuant to ss.

301 will adversely affect the person more substantially than the
302 general population of the geographical area in which the project
303 is located. A copy of the petition must also be provided to the
304 local government. If a petition is timely filed pursuant to this
305 subsection, the applicant may intervene as a party to the
306 hearing.
307 (c) Before issuing an order on an appeal or petition under
308 this subsection, the Department of Commerce must hold a hearing
309 in accordance with chapter 120.

313 department may attach conditions and restrictions to the order.
314 (e) Section 120.595 applies to proceedings brought by a
315 person whose substantial interests are or may be affected by the
