  323  conditions of the preserve while recognizing that a portion of
  324  the land will be used for some of the renewable surface

  326  the harmonious and coordinated management of the renewable
  327  surface resources without impairing the productivity of the land

  332  means the achievement and maintenance of a high level of annual

  349  for construction and maintenance of roads and facilities within
  350  the preserve.
  351         (d)âThis section does not affect the constitutional

  355  hunting, fishing, and trapping within the preserve.
  356         (e)âThis section does not interfere with or prevent the
  357  implementation of agricultural practices authorized by the
