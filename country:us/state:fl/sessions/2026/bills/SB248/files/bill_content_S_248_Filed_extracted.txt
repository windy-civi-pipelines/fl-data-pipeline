The written request to release the 476 removed information must be notarized, must confirm that a 477 protected partyâs request for release is pursuant to a 478 conveyance of his or her dwelling location, and must specify the 479 Official Records book and page, instrument number, or clerkâs 480 file number for each document containing the information to be 481 released. 482 9.âUpon the death of a protected party as verified by a 483 certified copy of a death certificate or court order, any party 484 can request the county recorder to release a protected 485 decedentâs removed information unless there is a related request 486 on file with the county recorder for continued removal of the 487 decedentâs information or unless such removal is otherwise 488 prohibited by statute or by court order. The written request to 489 release the removed information upon the death of a protected 490 party must attach the certified copy of a death certificate or 491 court order and must be notarized, must confirm the request for 492 release is due to the death of a protected party, and must 493 specify the Official Records book and page number, instrument 494 number, or clerkâs file number for each document containing the 495 information to be released.

Municipal clerks and their 513 staff often handle sensitive information and perform critical 514 administrative functions. Many municipal staff members who 515 perform duties that include, or result in, investigations into 516 complaints regarding election fraud, legal enforcement of 517 special magistrate hearings related to neglect or abuse, or 518 other activities that could lead to a criminal prosecution are 519 exposed to threats and other acts of violence. Protecting their 520 personal information is essential to ensure their safety. The 521 Legislature further finds that the harm that may result from the 522 release of such personal identifying and location information 523 outweighs any public benefit that may be derived from the 524 disclosure of the information. 525 Section 3.âThis act shall take effect July 1, 2026.

The custodian must maintain 426 an exemption granted pursuant to sub-subparagraph 2.z. until the 427 qualifying conditions for the exemption no longer apply to the 428 person subject to the exemption. 429 4.a.âA county property appraiser, as defined in s. 430 192.001(3), or a county tax collector, as defined in s. 431 192.001(4), who receives a written and notarized request for 432 maintenance of the exemption pursuant to subparagraph 3. must 433 comply by removing the name of the individual with exempt status 434 and the instrument number or Official Records book and page 435 number identifying the property with the exempt status from all 436 publicly available records maintained by the property appraiser 437 or tax collector. For written requests received on or before 438 July 1, 2021, a county property appraiser or county tax 439 collector must comply with this sub-subparagraph by October 1, 440 2021. A county property appraiser or county tax collector may 441 not remove the street address, legal description, or other 442 information identifying real property within the agencyâs 443 records so long as a name or personal information otherwise 444 exempt from inspection and copying pursuant to this section is 445 not associated with the property or otherwise displayed in the 446 public records of the agency. 447 b.âAny information restricted from public display, 448 inspection, or copying under sub-subparagraph a. must be 449 provided to the individual whose information was removed. 450 5.âAn officer, an employee, a justice, a judge, or other 451 person specified in subparagraph 2. may submit a written request 452 for the release of his or her exempt information to the 453 custodial agency. The written request must be notarized and must 454 specify the information to be released and the party authorized 455 to receive the information. Upon receipt of the written request, 456 the custodial agency must release the specified information to 457 the party authorized to receive such information. 458 6.âThe exemptions in this paragraph apply to information 459 held by an agency before, on, or after the effective date of the 460 exemption. 461 7.âInformation made exempt under this paragraph may be 462 disclosed pursuant to s. 28.2221 to a title insurer authorized 463 pursuant to s. 624.401 and its affiliates as defined in s. 464 624.10; a title insurance agent or title insurance agency as 465 defined in s. 626.841(1) or (2), respectively; or an attorney 466 duly admitted to practice law in this state and in good standing 467 with The Florida Bar. 468 8.âThe exempt status of a home address contained in the 469 Official Records is maintained only during the period when a 470 protected party resides at the dwelling location. Upon 471 conveyance of real property after October 1, 2021, and when such 472 real property no longer constitutes a protected partyâs home 473 address as defined in sub-subparagraph 1.a., the protected party 474 must submit a written request to release the removed information 475 to the county recorder. The written request to release the 476 removed information must be notarized, must confirm that a 477 protected partyâs request for release is pursuant to a 478 conveyance of his or her dwelling location, and must specify the 479 Official Records book and page, instrument number, or clerkâs 480 file number for each document containing the information to be 481 released. 482 9.âUpon the death of a protected party as verified by a 483 certified copy of a death certificate or court order, any party 484 can request the county recorder to release a protected 485 decedentâs removed information unless there is a related request 486 on file with the county recorder for continued removal of the 487 decedentâs information or unless such removal is otherwise 488 prohibited by statute or by court order. The written request to 489 release the removed information upon the death of a protected 490 party must attach the certified copy of a death certificate or 491 court order and must be notarized, must confirm the request for 492 release is due to the death of a protected party, and must 493 specify the Official Records book and page number, instrument 494 number, or clerkâs file number for each document containing the 495 information to be released. A fee may not be charged for the 496 release of any document pursuant to such request. 497 Section 2.âThe Legislature finds that it is a public 498 necessity that the home addresses, telephone numbers, dates of 499 birth, and photographs of current and former municipal clerks 500 and their staff, including elections filing officers, records 501 management liaison officers, and deputy or assistant municipal 502 clerks; the names, home addresses, telephone numbers, dates of 503 birth, and places of employment of the spouses and children of 504 current and former municipal clerks and their staff, including 505 elections filing officers, records management liaison officers, 506 and deputy or assistant municipal clerks; and the names and 507 locations of schools and day care facilities attended by the 508 children of current and former municipal clerks and their staff, 509 including elections filing officers, records management liaison 510 officers, and deputy or assistant municipal clerks, be made 511 exempt from s. 119.07(1), Florida Statutes, and s. 24(a), 512 Article I of the State Constitution. Municipal clerks and their 513 staff often handle sensitive information and perform critical 514 administrative functions. Many municipal staff members who 515 perform duties that include, or result in, investigations into 516 complaints regarding election fraud, legal enforcement of 517 special magistrate hearings related to neglect or abuse, or 518 other activities that could lead to a criminal prosecution are 519 exposed to threats and other acts of violence. Protecting their 520 personal information is essential to ensure their safety. The 521 Legislature further finds that the harm that may result from the 522 release of such personal identifying and location information 523 outweighs any public benefit that may be derived from the 524 disclosure of the information. 525 Section 3.âThis act shall take effect July 1, 2026.
