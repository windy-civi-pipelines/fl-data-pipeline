506 allegation that an incident of dating violence has occurred, the
507 officer shall handle the incident pursuant to the arrest policy
508 provided in s. 901.15(7), and as developed in accordance with
509 subsections (13), (14), and (16). Whether or not an arrest is
510 made, the officer shall make a written police report that is

530 subsequent, supplemental, or related report, which excludes
531 victim or witness statements or other materials that are part of
532 an active criminal investigation and are exempt from disclosure
533 under chapter 119, to the nearest locally certified domestic
534 violence center within 24 hours after the agency's receipt of
535 the report. The report furnished to the domestic violence center
536 must include a narrative description of the dating violence
537 incident.
538 (13) Whenever a law enforcement officer determines upon

540 within the jurisdiction, or that a person has violated a
541 condition of pretrial release as provided in s. 903.047 and the
542 original arrest was for an act of dating violence, the officer
543 may arrest the person or persons suspected of its commission and
544 charge such person or persons with the appropriate crime. The
545 decision to arrest and charge does shall not require consent of
546 the victim or consideration of the relationship of the parties.

554 primary aggressor. Arrest is the preferred response only with
555 respect to the primary aggressor and not the preferred response
556 with respect to a person who acts in a reasonable manner to
557 protect or defend himself or herself or another family or
558 household member from dating violence.

560 pretrial release provided in s. 903.047, when the original
561 arrest was for an act of dating violence as defined in this
562 section, commits a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable

646 and time-sharing schedule requires a showing of a substantial
647 and material change of circumstances.

649 child has frequent and continuing contact with both parents
650 after the parents separate or the marriage of the parties is

651 dissolved and to encourage parents to share the rights and
652 responsibilities, and joys, of childrearing. Unless otherwise
653 provided in this section or agreed to by the parties, there is a
654 rebuttable presumption that equal time-sharing of a minor child
655 is in the best interests of the minor child. To rebut this
656 presumption, a party must prove by a preponderance of the
657 evidence that equal time-sharing is not in the best interests of
658 the minor child. Except when a time-sharing schedule is agreed
659 to by the parties and approved by the court, the court must
660 evaluate all of the factors set forth in subsection (3) and make
661 specific written findings of fact when creating or modifying a
662 time-sharing schedule.
663 2. The court shall order that the parental responsibility
664 for a minor child be shared by both parents unless the court
665 finds that shared parental responsibility would be detrimental
666 to the child. In determining detriment to the child, the court
667 shall consider:
668 a. Evidence of domestic violence, as defined in s. 741.28;
669 b. Whether either parent has or has had reasonable cause
670 to believe that he or she or his or her minor child or children
671 are or have been in imminent danger of becoming victims of an
672 act of domestic violence as defined in s. 741.28 or sexual
673 violence as defined in s. 784.046(1) s. 784.046(1)(c) by the

675 whom the parents share in common regardless of whether a cause

676 of action has been brought or is currently pending in the court;
677 c. Whether either parent has or has had reasonable cause
678 to believe that his or her minor child or children are or have
679 been in imminent danger of becoming victims of an act of abuse,
680 abandonment, or neglect, as those terms are defined in s. 39.01,
681 by the other parent against the child or children whom the
682 parents share in common regardless of whether a cause of action
683 has been brought or is currently pending in the court; and
684 d. Any other relevant factors.
685 3. The following evidence creates a rebuttable presumption
686 that shared parental responsibility is detrimental to the child:
687 a. A parent has been convicted of a misdemeanor of the
688 first degree or higher involving domestic violence, as defined
689 in s. 741.28 and chapter 775;
690 b. A parent meets the criteria of s. 39.806(1)(d); or
691 c. A parent has been convicted of or had adjudication
692 withheld for an offense enumerated in s. 943.0435(1)(h)1.a., and
693 at the time of the offense:
694 (I) The parent was 18 years of age or older.
695 (II) The victim was under 18 years of age or the parent
696 believed the victim to be under 18 years of age.
697
698 If the presumption is not rebutted after the convicted parent is
699 advised by the court that the presumption exists, shared
700 parental responsibility, including time-sharing with the child,

HB 547 2026
701 and decisions made regarding the child, may not be granted to
702 the convicted parent. However, the convicted parent is not
703 relieved of any obligation to provide financial support. If the
704 court determines that shared parental responsibility would be
705 detrimental to the child, it may order sole parental
706 responsibility and make such arrangements for time-sharing as
707 specified in the parenting plan as will best protect the child
708 or abused spouse from further harm. Whether or not there is a
709 conviction of any offense of domestic violence or child abuse or
710 the existence of an injunction for protection against domestic
711 violence, the court shall consider evidence of domestic violence
712 or child abuse as evidence of detriment to the child.
713 4. In ordering shared parental responsibility, the court
714 may consider the expressed desires of the parents and may grant
715 to one party the ultimate responsibility over specific aspects
716 of the child's welfare or may divide those responsibilities
717 between the parties based on the best interests of the child.
718 Areas of responsibility may include education, health care, and
719 any other responsibilities that the court finds unique to a
720 particular family.
721 5. The court shall order sole parental responsibility for
722 a minor child to one parent, with or without time-sharing with
723 the other parent if it is in the best interests of the minor
724 child.
725 6. There is a rebuttable presumption against granting

726 time-sharing with a minor child if a parent has been convicted
727 of or had adjudication withheld for an offense enumerated in s.
728 943.0435(1)(h)1.a., and at the time of the offense:
729 a. The parent was 18 years of age or older.
730 b. The victim was under 18 years of age or the parent
731 believed the victim to be under 18 years of age.
732
733 A parent may rebut the presumption upon a specific finding in
734 writing by the court that the parent poses no significant risk
735 of harm to the child and that time-sharing is in the best
736 interests of the minor child. If the presumption is rebutted,
737 the court must consider all time-sharing factors in subsection
738 (3) when developing a time-sharing schedule.
739 7. Access to records and information pertaining to a minor
740 child, including, but not limited to, medical, dental, and
741 school records, may not be denied to either parent. Full rights
742 under this subparagraph apply to either parent unless a court
743 order specifically revokes these rights, including any
744 restrictions on these rights as provided in a domestic violence
745 injunction. A parent having rights under this subparagraph has
746 the same rights upon request as to form, substance, and manner
747 of access as are available to the other parent of a child,
748 including, without limitation, the right to in-person
749 communication with medical, dental, and education providers.
