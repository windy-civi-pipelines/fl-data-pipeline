    2         An act relating to beach management; amending s.
    3         161.101, F.S.; requiring the Department of
    4         Environmental Protection to review certain data when
    5         designating certain beaches as critically eroded and
    6         in need of restoration and nourishment; requiring that
    7         certain beaches, whose local government preserved
    8         funds for a certain purpose and which possess

   12         strategic beach management plan; requiring that such
   13         plans include an analysis of certain information;

   15         conforming a provision to changes made by the act;
   16         amending s. 380.05, F.S.; revising the list of areas

   19         F.S., relating to resource planning and management
   20         committees and objectives and procedures, to
   21         incorporate the amendment made to s. 380.05, F.S., in
   22         references thereto; providing an effective date.
   23          
   24  Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Florida:
   25  
   26         Section 1.âSubsections (1) and (2) of section 161.101,
   27  Florida Statutes, are amended to read:
   28         161.101âState and local participation in authorized
   29  projects and studies relating to beach management and erosion
   30  control.â
   31         (1)<u class="Insert">(a)</u>âThe Legislature recognizes that beach erosion is a
   32  statewide problem that does not confine its effects to local
   33  governmental jurisdictions and that beach erosion can be
   34  adequately addressed most efficiently by a state-initiated
   35  program of beach restoration and beach nourishment. However,
   36  since local beach communities derive the primary benefits from
   37  the presence of adequate beaches, a program of beach restoration
   38  and beach nourishment should not be accomplished without a
   39  commitment of local funds to combat the problem of beach
   40  erosion.
   41         <u class="Insert">(b)</u>âAccordingly, the Legislature declares that the state,
   42  through the department, shall determine those beaches which are
   43  critically eroded and in need of restoration and nourishment and
   44  may authorize appropriations to pay up to 75 percent of the
   45  actual costs for restoring and nourishing a critically eroded
   46  beach. <u class="Insert">The local government in which </u><u class="Insert">such a</u><u class="Insert"> beach is located </u><u class="Insert">is</u>
   47  <u class="Insert">responsible for the balance of such costs.</u><u class="Insert"> In designating</u>
   48  <u class="Insert">beaches as critically eroded,</u><u class="Insert"> </u><u class="Insert">the department shall review data</u>
   49  <u class="Insert">related to beaches that have been preemptively and repeatedly</u>
   50  <u class="Insert">repaired to avoid complete erosion and for which private</u>
   51  <u class="Insert">funding, local government funding, and state and federal grants</u>
   52  <u class="Insert">have been expended to stop or mitigate such erosion.</u>
   53         <u class="Insert">(c)</u><u class="Insert">â</u><u class="Insert">If a local government </u><u class="Insert">with jurisdiction over </u><u class="Insert">a</u><u class="Insert"> </u><u class="Insert">beach</u>
   54  <u class="Insert">that possesses all of the following features has a financial</u>

   69         (2)<u class="Insert">(a)</u>âTo carry out the beach and shore preservation
   70  programs, the department is hereby constituted as the beach and
   71  shore preservation authority for the state. In this capacity,
   72  the secretary of the department may at his or her own initiative
   73  take all necessary steps as soon as practicable and desirable to
   74  implement the provisions of this chapter.
   75         <u class="Insert">(b)</u><u class="Insert">â</u><u class="Insert">The secretary of the department may, as he or she deems</u>
   76  <u class="Insert">necessary, require coastal local governments to develop local</u>

   89         Section 2.âParagraph (a) of subsection (2) of section
   90  161.161, Florida Statutes, is amended to read:
   91         161.161âProcedure for approval of projects.â
   92         (2)âThe comprehensive long-term management plan developed
   93  and maintained by the department pursuant to subsection (1) must
   94  include, at a minimum, a strategic beach management plan, a
   95  critically eroded beaches report, and a statewide long-range
   96  budget plan. The long-range budget plan must include a 3-year
   97  work plan for beach restoration, beach nourishment, and inlet
   98  management projects that lists planned projects for each of the
   99  3 fiscal years addressed in the work plan.
  100         (a)âThe strategic beach management plan must identify and
  101  recommend appropriate measures for all of the stateâs critically
  102  eroded sandy beaches and may incorporate plans prepared at the
  103  regional level, <u class="Insert">including plans developed pursuant to s.</u>
  104  <u class="Insert">161.101(2)(b),</u> taking into account areas of greatest need and

  107  work plan identified in subparagraph (c)1., must serve as the
  108  basis for state funding decisions. Before finalizing the

  156  state concern pursuant to s. 380.05, the Governor, acting as the
  157  chief planning officer of the state, shall appoint a resource
  158  planning and management committee for the area under study by
  159  the state land planning agency. The objective of the committee
  160  shall be to organize a voluntary, cooperative resource planning
  161  and management program to resolve existing, and prevent future,
  162  problems which may endanger those resources, facilities, and
  163  areas described in s. 380.05(2) within the area under study by
  164  the state land planning agency.
  165         (3)âNot later than 12 months after its appointment by the

  169  management program not be adopted. The proposed voluntary
  170  resource planning and management program shall contain the
  171  committee findings with respect to problems that endanger those
  172  resources, facilities, and areas described in s. 380.05(2) and

  177  management program shall be the effective coordination of state,
  178  regional, and local planning; program implementation; and
  179  regulatory activities for comprehensive resource management. The
  180  committee shall submit the proposed voluntary resource planning
  181  and management program to the head of the state land planning
  182  agency, who shall transmit the program along with the
  183  recommendations of the agency for monitoring and enforcing the
  184  program, as well as any other recommendations deemed
  185  appropriate, to the Administration Commission.
  186         (5)âThe state land planning agency shall report to the
  187  Administration Commission within 12 months of the approval of
  188  the program by the commission concerning the implementation and
  189  the effects of the approved voluntary resource planning and
  190  management program. The report shall include, but shall not be
  191  limited to:
  192         (a)âAn assessment of state agency compliance with the
  193  program, including the degree to which the program
  194  recommendations have been integrated into agency planning,
  195  program implementation, regulatory activities, and rules;
  196         (b)âAn assessment of the compliance by each affected local
  197  government with the program;
  198         (c)âAn evaluation of state, regional, and local monitoring
  199  and enforcement activities and recommendations for improving
  200  such activities; and
  201         (d)âA recommendation as to whether or not all or any
  202  portion of the study area should be designated an area of
  203  critical state concern pursuant to s. 380.05.
  204  
  205  The state land planning agency may make such other reports to
  206  the commission as it deems necessary, including recommending
  207  that all or any portion of the study area be designated an area
  208  of critical state concern because of special circumstances in
  209  the study area or in the implementation of the approved
  210  voluntary resource planning and management program.
  211         Section 5.âThis act shall take effect July 1, 2026.
