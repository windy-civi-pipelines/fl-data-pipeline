  161  supervision if he or she is living in a residence that meets the

  177         5.âIf the victim was under the age of 18, a prohibition
  178  against contact with children under the age of 18 without review
  179  and approval by the commission. The commission may approve
  180  supervised contact with a child under the age of 18 if the
  181  approval is based upon a recommendation for contact issued by a
  182  qualified practitioner who is basing the recommendation on a
  183  risk assessment. Further, the sex offender must be currently
  184  enrolled in or have successfully completed a sex offender
  185  therapy program. The commission may not grant supervised contact
  186  with a child if the contact is not recommended by a qualified

  216  the proposed contact, when age-appropriate;
  217         (XII)âThe parentâs or legal guardianâs preference regarding
  218  the proposed contact; and
  219         (XIII)âThe qualified practitionerâs opinion, along with the
  220  basis for that opinion, as to whether the proposed contact would
  221  likely pose significant risk of emotional or physical harm to
  222  the child.
  223  
  224  The written report of the assessment must be given to the
  225  commission.
  226         b.âA recommendation made as a part of the risk-assessment
  227  report as to whether supervised contact with the child should be
  228  approved;
  229         c.âA written consent signed by the childâs parent or legal
  230  guardian, if the parent or legal guardian is not the sex
  231  offender, agreeing to the sex offender having supervised contact
  232  with the child after receiving full disclosure of the sex
  233  offenderâs present legal status, past criminal history, and the
  234  results of the risk assessment. The commission may not approve
  235  contact with the child if the parent or legal guardian refuses
  236  to give written consent for supervised contact;
  237         d.âA safety plan prepared by the qualified practitioner,
  238  who provides treatment to the offender, in collaboration with
  239  the sex offender, the childâs parent or legal guardian, and the
  240  child, when age appropriate, which details the acceptable
  241  conditions of contact between the sex offender and the child.
  242  The safety plan must be reviewed and approved by the Department
  243  of Corrections before being submitted to the commission; and
  244         e.âEvidence that the childâs parent or legal guardian, if
  245  the parent or legal guardian is not the sex offender,
  246  understands the need for and agrees to the safety plan and has
  247  agreed to provide, or to designate another adult to provide,
  248  constant supervision any time the child is in contact with the
  249  offender.
  250  
  251  The commission may not appoint a person to conduct a risk
  252  assessment and may not accept a risk assessment from a person
  253  who has not demonstrated to the commission that he or she has
