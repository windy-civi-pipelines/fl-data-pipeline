51 cyberstalking, and any affidavits, notice of hearing, and

53 119.07(1) and s. 24(a), Art. I of the State Constitution until
54 the respondent has been personally served with a copy of the
55 petition for injunction, affidavits, notice of hearing, and
56 temporary injunction.
57 Section 2. (1) The Legislature finds that it is a public
58 necessity that a petition, and the contents thereof, for an
59 injunction for protection against serious violence by a known
60 person which is dismissed without a hearing, dismissed at an ex
61 parte hearing due to failure to state a claim or lack of
62 jurisdiction, or dismissed for any reason having to do with the
63 sufficiency of the petition itself without an injunction being
64 issued be made exempt from s. 119.07(1), Florida Statutes, and
65 s. 24(a), Article I of the State Constitution. The Legislature
66 finds that the existence of, and the unverified allegations
67 contained in, such a petition may be defamatory to an individual
68 named in it and cause unwarranted damage to the reputation of
69 such individual. The Legislature further finds that removing
70 such a record from public disclosure is the sole means of
71 protecting the reputation of such an individual.
72 (2) Additionally, the Legislature finds that it is a
73 public necessity that any information that can be used to

76 affidavits, notice of hearing, and temporary injunction, be made
77 confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1), Florida Statutes, and
78 s. 24(a), Article I of the State Constitution. The release of
79 such information before the respondent has been personally
80 served with a copy of the petition, affidavits, notice of
81 hearing, or temporary injunction could significantly threaten
82 the physical safety and security of persons seeking protection
83 through injunctive proceedings and their families, and of law
84 enforcement tasked with serving the petition for injunction,
85 affidavits, notice of hearing, or temporary injunction on the
86 respondent. The harm that may result from the release of the
87 information outweighs any public benefit that might result from
88 public disclosure of the information.
89 Section 3. This act shall take effect on the same date
90 that HB 547 or similar legislation takes effect, if such
91 legislation is adopted in the same legislative session or an
92 extension thereof and becomes a law.
