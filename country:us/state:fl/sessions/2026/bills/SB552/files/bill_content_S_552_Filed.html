  157  during tax levy, assessment, and collection are available only
  158  insofar as they are implemented in other parts of the Florida
  159  Statutes or rules of the Department of Revenue. The rights so

  408  of attorney, unless the person filing the petition is listed in

  479  as special magistrates. Employees and elected or appointed
  480  officials of a taxing jurisdiction or of the state may not serve
  481  as special magistrates. The clerk of the board shall annually
  482  notify such individuals or their professional associations to

  488  or less for payments made to special magistrates appointed for
  489  the purpose of taking testimony and making recommendations to
  490  the value adjustment board pursuant to this section. The
  491  department shall establish a reasonable range for payments per
  492  case to special magistrates based on such payments in other
  493  counties. Requests for reimbursement of payments outside this
  494  range shall be justified by the county. If the total of all
  495  requests for reimbursement in any year exceeds the amount

  519  county in which he or she serves. A special magistrate may not

  521  he or she has served that board as a special magistrate. An
  522  appraisal may not be submitted as evidence to a value adjustment
  523  board in any year that the person who performed the appraisal
  524  serves as a special magistrate to that value adjustment board.
  525  Before appointing a special magistrate, a value adjustment board
  526  shall verify the special magistrateâs qualifications. The value
  527  adjustment board shall ensure that the selection of special
  528  magistrates is based solely upon the experience and
  529  qualifications of the special magistrate and is not influenced
  530  by the property appraiser. The special magistrate shall
  531  accurately and completely preserve all testimony and, in making
  532  recommendations to the value adjustment board, shall include
  533  proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law, and reasons for
  534  upholding or overturning the determination of the property
  535  appraiser. The expense of hearings before magistrates and any
  536  compensation of special magistrates shall be borne three-fifths
  537  by the board of county commissioners and two-fifths by the
  538  school board. When appointing special magistrates or when

  541  dollar amount or percentage of any assessment reductions

 1005  in this manner, the cost of the building materials is deemed to

 1273  services must be attached to the sworn statement provided by the

 1315  subject to assessment.
 1316         6.âOnly one exemption through a refund of previously paid
 1317  taxes for the new construction may be claimed for any single
 1318  parcel of property unless there is a change in ownership, a new
 1319  lessor, or a new lessee of the real property. A refund may not
 1320  be granted unless the amount to be refunded exceeds $500. A
 1321  refund may not exceed the lesser of 97.5 percent of the Florida
