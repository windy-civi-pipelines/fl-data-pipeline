79 (1)
80 (c)1. A custodian of public records and his or her
81 designee must acknowledge requests to inspect or copy records
82 promptly and respond to such requests in good faith. A good
83 faith response includes making reasonable efforts to determine
84 from other officers or employees within the agency whether such
85 a record exists and, if so, the location at which the record can
86 be accessed. Failure to acknowledge a public records request
87 promptly and respond to such request in good faith is a
88 violation of this chapter.
89 2.a. No later than 3 business days after receiving a
90 public records request, a custodian of public records must:
91 (I) Provide the requested records;
92 (II) Provide the requester a good faith estimate of a
93 reasonable amount of time in which the custodian will provide
94 the records and a good faith estimate of any costs that will be
95 assessed for complying with the request; or

97 thereof, is denied, deny the request, in whole or in part, and
98 cite the statutory exemption authorizing the denial as provided
99 in paragraphs (e) and (f).
100 b. If the custodian of public records fails to take any of
101 the actions described in sub-subparagraph a. within 3 business
102 days after receiving the public records request, the agency may
103 not impose costs or fees for providing the requested public
104 record.
105 c. Notwithstanding sub-subparagraph a., there is no
106 presumption in any civil action brought to enforce a requester's
107 right to inspect or copy public records that a request was not
108 unlawfully delayed because an agency complied with sub-
109 subparagraph a.
110 (f) If requested by the person seeking to inspect or copy
111 the record, the custodian of public records shall state in
112 writing and with particularity:
113 1. The reasons for taking more than 15 days to provide the
114 requested record; or
115 2. The reasons for the conclusion that the record is
116 exempt or confidential, including all statutory citations relied
117 upon in determining that the record is exempt or confidential.
118 (g)1. In any civil action in which an exemption to this
119 section is asserted, if the exemption is alleged to exist under
120 or by virtue of s. 119.071(1)(d) or (f), (2)(d), (e), or (f), or

121 (4)(c), the public record or part thereof in question shall be
122 submitted to the court for an inspection in camera. If an
123 exemption is alleged to exist under or by virtue of s.
124 119.071(2)(c), an inspection in camera is discretionary with the
125 court. If the court finds that the asserted exemption is not
126 applicable, it shall order the public record or part thereof in
127 question to be immediately produced for inspection or copying as
128 requested by the person seeking such access.
129 2. In any civil action brought by a requester to enforce
130 the right to public records, an agency may not assert any
131 exemption or justification for not providing the public records
132 requested which it has not previously raised in a written
133 response to the requester before the civil action was filed to
134 justify the agency's nondisclosure or delay in providing the
135 public records requested.
136 3. In any civil action brought by a requester alleging
137 that an agency unlawfully delayed providing public records, a
138 public records request backlog or other unfulfilled public
139 records requests to the agency is not deemed a justification, in
140 whole or in part, for the alleged delay.
141 (2)
142 (c) Unless otherwise required by law, the custodian of
143 public records may charge a fee for remote electronic access,
144 granted under a contractual arrangement with a user, which fee

148 this section.
149 (3)
150 (d) Photographing of public records shall be done in the
151 room where the public records are kept. If, in the judgment of
152 the custodian of public records, this is impossible or
153 impracticable, photographing shall be done in another room or
154 place, as nearly adjacent as possible to the room where the
155 public records are kept, to be determined by the custodian of
156 public records. Where provision of another room or place for
157 photographing is required, the expense of providing the same
158 shall be paid by the person desiring to photograph the public
159 record pursuant to paragraph (4)(h) (4)(e).
160 (4) The custodian of public records shall furnish a copy
161 or a certified copy of the record upon payment of the fee
162 prescribed by law.
163 (a) If a fee is not prescribed by law, the following fees
164 are authorized:

166 1. Up to 15 cents per one-sided copy for duplicated copies
167 of not more than 14 inches by 8 1/2 inches;

176 duplication or any other costs or fees to the requester.
177 (b)1. For purposes of this paragraph, the term "any
178 electronic medium stored, maintained, or used by an agency"
179 means any electronic format that the agency can reasonably
180 provide as part of the standard operation of its electronic
181 recordkeeping system. If an agency is able to convert the record
182 into the electronic format requested as a step in the process of
183 copying or exporting the requested record, the agency must
184 provide the record in the format requested and may charge a fee
185 authorized by this subsection.
186 2. For a copy of a public record in any electronic medium
187 stored, maintained, or used by an agency, the actual cost of
188 duplication. However, if the nature or volume of the public

196 records request made to that agency.

209 or fee for the first 10 hours of time the agency estimates it
210 would take to comply with the request.

224 agency involved, or both, the agency may charge, in addition to
225 the actual cost of duplication, a special service charge, which
226 shall be reasonable and shall be based on the cost incurred for
227 such extensive use of information technology resources or the
228 labor cost of the personnel providing the service that is
229 actually incurred by the agency or attributable to the agency
230 for the clerical and supervisory assistance required, or both.

HB 437 2026
73 Section 2. Paragraphs (c), (f), and (g) of subsection (1),
74 paragraph (c) of subsection (2), paragraph (d) of subsection
75 (3), and subsection (4) of section 119.07, Florida Statutes, are
76 amended to read:
77 119.07 Inspection and copying of records; photographing
78 public records; fees; exemptions.—
79 (1)
80 (c)1. A custodian of public records and his or her
81 designee must acknowledge requests to inspect or copy records
82 promptly and respond to such requests in good faith. A good
83 faith response includes making reasonable efforts to determine
84 from other officers or employees within the agency whether such
85 a record exists and, if so, the location at which the record can
86 be accessed. Failure to acknowledge a public records request
87 promptly and respond to such request in good faith is a
88 violation of this chapter.
89 2.a. No later than 3 business days after receiving a
90 public records request, a custodian of public records must:
91 (I) Provide the requested records;
92 (II) Provide the requester a good faith estimate of a
93 reasonable amount of time in which the custodian will provide
94 the records and a good faith estimate of any costs that will be
95 assessed for complying with the request; or
96 (III) To the extent any records request, or any portion

97 thereof, is denied, deny the request, in whole or in part, and
98 cite the statutory exemption authorizing the denial as provided
99 in paragraphs (e) and (f).
100 b. If the custodian of public records fails to take any of
101 the actions described in sub-subparagraph a. within 3 business
102 days after receiving the public records request, the agency may
103 not impose costs or fees for providing the requested public
104 record.
105 c. Notwithstanding sub-subparagraph a., there is no
106 presumption in any civil action brought to enforce a requester's
107 right to inspect or copy public records that a request was not
108 unlawfully delayed because an agency complied with sub-
109 subparagraph a.
110 (f) If requested by the person seeking to inspect or copy
111 the record, the custodian of public records shall state in
112 writing and with particularity:
113 1. The reasons for taking more than 15 days to provide the
114 requested record; or
115 2. The reasons for the conclusion that the record is
116 exempt or confidential, including all statutory citations relied
117 upon in determining that the record is exempt or confidential.
118 (g)1. In any civil action in which an exemption to this
119 section is asserted, if the exemption is alleged to exist under
120 or by virtue of s. 119.071(1)(d) or (f), (2)(d), (e), or (f), or

121 (4)(c), the public record or part thereof in question shall be
122 submitted to the court for an inspection in camera. If an
123 exemption is alleged to exist under or by virtue of s.
124 119.071(2)(c), an inspection in camera is discretionary with the
125 court. If the court finds that the asserted exemption is not
126 applicable, it shall order the public record or part thereof in
127 question to be immediately produced for inspection or copying as
128 requested by the person seeking such access.
129 2. In any civil action brought by a requester to enforce
130 the right to public records, an agency may not assert any
131 exemption or justification for not providing the public records
132 requested which it has not previously raised in a written
133 response to the requester before the civil action was filed to
134 justify the agency's nondisclosure or delay in providing the
135 public records requested.
136 3. In any civil action brought by a requester alleging
137 that an agency unlawfully delayed providing public records, a
138 public records request backlog or other unfulfilled public
139 records requests to the agency is not deemed a justification, in
140 whole or in part, for the alleged delay.
141 (2)
142 (c) Unless otherwise required by law, the custodian of
143 public records may charge a fee for remote electronic access,
144 granted under a contractual arrangement with a user, which fee

145 may include the direct and indirect costs of providing such
146 access. Fees for remote electronic access provided to the
147 general public shall be in accordance with the provisions of
148 this section.
149 (3)
150 (d) Photographing of public records shall be done in the
151 room where the public records are kept. If, in the judgment of
152 the custodian of public records, this is impossible or
153 impracticable, photographing shall be done in another room or
154 place, as nearly adjacent as possible to the room where the
155 public records are kept, to be determined by the custodian of
156 public records. Where provision of another room or place for
157 photographing is required, the expense of providing the same
158 shall be paid by the person desiring to photograph the public
159 record pursuant to paragraph (4)(h) (4)(e).
160 (4) The custodian of public records shall furnish a copy
161 or a certified copy of the record upon payment of the fee
162 prescribed by law.
163 (a) If a fee is not prescribed by law, the following fees
164 are authorized:
165 (a)
