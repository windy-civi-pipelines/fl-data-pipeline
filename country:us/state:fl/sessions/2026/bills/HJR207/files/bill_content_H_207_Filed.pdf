101 owner applies and is eligible for the exemption, and who has
102 maintained thereon the permanent residence of the owner for not
103 less than twenty-five years, who has attained age sixty-five,
104 and whose household income does not exceed the income limitation
105 prescribed in paragraph (1).
106
107 The general law must allow counties and municipalities to grant
108 these additional exemptions, within the limits prescribed in
109 this subsection, by ordinance adopted in the manner prescribed
110 by general law, and must provide for the periodic adjustment of

114 partially or totally permanently disabled shall receive a
115 discount from the amount of the ad valorem tax otherwise owed on
116 homestead property the veteran owns and resides in if the
117 disability was combat related and the veteran was honorably
118 discharged upon separation from military service. The discount
119 shall be in a percentage equal to the percentage of the
120 veteran's permanent, service-connected disability as determined

122 for the discount granted by this paragraph, an applicant must
123 submit to the county property appraiser, by March 1, an official

126 disability and such evidence that reasonably identifies the
127 disability as combat related and a copy of the veteran's
128 honorable discharge. If the property appraiser denies the
129 request for a discount, the appraiser must notify the applicant
130 in writing of the reasons for the denial, and the veteran may
131 reapply. The Legislature may, by general law, waive the annual
132 application requirement in subsequent years.
133 (2) If a veteran who receives the discount described in
134 paragraph (1) predeceases his or her spouse, and if, upon the
135 death of the veteran, the surviving spouse holds the legal or
136 beneficial title to the homestead property and permanently
137 resides thereon, the discount carries over to the surviving
138 spouse until he or she remarries or sells or otherwise disposes
139 of the homestead property. If the surviving spouse sells or
140 otherwise disposes of the property, a discount not to exceed the
141 dollar amount granted from the most recent ad valorem tax roll
142 may be transferred to the surviving spouse's new homestead
143 property, if used as his or her permanent residence and he or
144 she has not remarried.
145 (3) This subsection is self-executing and does not require
146 implementing legislation.
147 (f) By general law and subject to conditions and
148 limitations specified therein, the Legislature may provide ad
149 valorem tax relief equal to the total amount or a portion of the
150 ad valorem tax otherwise owed on homestead property to:
