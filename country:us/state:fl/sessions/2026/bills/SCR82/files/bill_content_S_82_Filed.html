       26-00321-26                                             202682__
    1                    Senate Concurrent Resolution                   
    2         A concurrent resolution ratifying the proposed
    3         amendment to the United States Constitution relating
    4         to equal rights for men and women.
    5  
    6         WHEREAS, during the Second Session of the 92nd Congress of
    7  the United States of America, by a constitutional majority of
    8  two-thirds, both houses of Congress approved the Equal Rights
    9  Amendment, and
   10         WHEREAS, on March 22, 1972, this proposed amendment to the
   11  United States Constitution was sent to the states for
   12  ratification, and
   13         WHEREAS, Article V of the United States Constitution
   14  authorizes the Florida Legislature to ratify proposed amendments
   15  to the United States Constitution, and
   16         WHEREAS, the 1972 Equal Rights Amendment contained a 7-year
   17  period for ratification, a deadline the United States Congress
   18  later extended to 1982 after 35 states ratified the amendment,
   19  and
   20         WHEREAS, in 2021, the United States House of
   21  Representatives passed a measure to eliminate retroactively the
   22  ratification deadline from the amendment, and the United States
   23  Senate introduced a companion measure, and
   24         WHEREAS, constitutional equality for men and women
   25  continues to be timely in the United States and worldwide, and
   26  many other nations have achieved constitutional equality for men
   27  and women, NOW, THEREFORE,
   28  
   29  Be It Resolved by the Senate of the State of Florida, the House
   30  of Representatives Concurring:
   31  
   32         That the proposed amendment to the Constitution of the
   33  United States set forth below is ratified by the Legislature of
   34  the State of Florida.
   35                            âARTICLE ____                          
   36         SECTION 1.âEquality of rights under the law shall not be
