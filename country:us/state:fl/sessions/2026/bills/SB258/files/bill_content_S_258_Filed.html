  495         Section 2.â<u class="Insert">The Legislature finds that it is a public</u>
  496  <u class="Insert">necessity that the home addresses, telephone numbers, dates of</u>
  497  <u class="Insert">birth, and photographs of current and former medical examiners;</u>
  498  <u class="Insert">the names, home addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth,</u>
  499  <u class="Insert">and places of employment of the spouses and children of current</u>
  500  <u class="Insert">and former medical examiners; and the names and locations of</u>
  501  <u class="Insert">schools and day care facilities attended by the children of</u>
  502  <u class="Insert">current and former medical examiners be made exempt from s.</u>
  503  <u class="Insert">119.07(1), Florida Statutes, and s. 24(a), Article I of the</u>
  504  <u class="Insert">State Constitution. The Legislature finds that the release of</u>
  505  <u class="Insert">such personal identifying and location information poses</u>
  506  <u class="Insert">potential security risks for and allows unwarranted intrusion</u>
  507  <u class="Insert">into the private lives of such current and former medical</u>
  508  <u class="Insert">examiners and their family members. Public availability of such</u>
  509  <u class="Insert">personal identifying and location information may compromise the</u>
  510  <u class="Insert">ability of such current and former medical examiners to carry</u>
  511  <u class="Insert">out their public duties and may disrupt the operation of the</u>
  512  <u class="Insert">medical examinersâ offices. The exemption of such personal</u>
  513  <u class="Insert">identifying and location information from public records</u>
  514  <u class="Insert">requirements is necessary to protect the personal privacy and</u>
  515  <u class="Insert">safety of these public servants and their families. The</u>
  516  <u class="Insert">Legislature finds that the harm that may result from the release</u>
  517  <u class="Insert">of such personal identifying and location information outweighs</u>
  518  <u class="Insert">any public benefit that may be derived from the disclosure of</u>
  519  <u class="Insert">the information.</u>
  520         Section 3.âThis act shall take effect upon becoming a law.
