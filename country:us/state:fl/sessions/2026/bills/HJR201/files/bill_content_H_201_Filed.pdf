102 by general law, and must provide for the periodic adjustment of
103 the income limitation prescribed in this subsection for changes
104 in the cost of living.
105 (d)(e)(1) Each veteran who is age 65 or older who is
106 partially or totally permanently disabled shall receive a
107 discount from the amount of the ad valorem tax otherwise owed on
108 homestead property the veteran owns and resides in if the
109 disability was combat related and the veteran was honorably
110 discharged upon separation from military service. The discount
111 shall be in a percentage equal to the percentage of the
112 veteran's permanent, service-connected disability as determined
113 by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. To qualify
114 for the discount granted by this paragraph, an applicant must
115 submit to the county property appraiser, by March 1, an official
116 letter from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs
117 stating the percentage of the veteran's service-connected
118 disability and such evidence that reasonably identifies the
119 disability as combat related and a copy of the veteran's
120 honorable discharge. If the property appraiser denies the
121 request for a discount, the appraiser must notify the applicant
122 in writing of the reasons for the denial, and the veteran may
123 reapply. The Legislature may, by general law, waive the annual
124 application requirement in subsequent years.

126 paragraph (1) predeceases his or her spouse, and if, upon the
127 death of the veteran, the surviving spouse holds the legal or
128 beneficial title to the homestead property and permanently
129 resides thereon, the discount carries over to the surviving
130 spouse until he or she remarries or sells or otherwise disposes
131 of the homestead property. If the surviving spouse sells or
132 otherwise disposes of the property, a discount not to exceed the
133 dollar amount granted from the most recent ad valorem tax roll
134 may be transferred to the surviving spouse's new homestead
135 property, if used as his or her permanent residence and he or
136 she has not remarried.
137 (3) This subsection is self-executing and does not require
138 implementing legislation.
139 (e)(f) By general law and subject to conditions and
140 limitations specified therein, the Legislature may provide ad
141 valorem tax relief equal to the total amount or a portion of the
142 ad valorem tax otherwise owed on homestead property to:
143 (1) The surviving spouse of a veteran who died from
144 service-connected causes while on active duty as a member of the
145 United States Armed Forces.
146 (2) The surviving spouse of a first responder who died in
147 the line of duty.
148 (3) A first responder who is totally and permanently
149 disabled as a result of an injury or injuries sustained in the
150 line of duty. Causal connection between a disability and service

151 in the line of duty shall not be presumed but must be determined
152 as provided by general law. For purposes of this paragraph, the
153 term "disability" does not include a chronic condition or
154 chronic disease, unless the injury sustained in the line of duty
155 was the sole cause of the chronic condition or chronic disease.
156
157 As used in this subsection and as further defined by general
158 law, the term "first responder" means a law enforcement officer,
159 a correctional officer, a firefighter, an emergency medical
160 technician, or a paramedic, and the term "in the line of duty"
161 means arising out of and in the actual performance of duty
162 required by employment as a first responder.
