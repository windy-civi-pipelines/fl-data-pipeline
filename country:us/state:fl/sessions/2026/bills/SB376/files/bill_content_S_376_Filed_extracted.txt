A fee may not be charged for the 482 release of any document pursuant to such request. 483 Section 2.âThe Legislature finds that it is a public 484 necessity that the home addresses, telephone numbers, dates of 485 birth, and photographs of sexual assault counselors, as defined 486 in s. 90.5035(1), Florida Statutes, be made exempt from s. 487 119.07(1), Florida Statutes, and s. 24(a), Article I of the 488 State Constitution. Sexual assault counselors regularly support 489 individuals who are victims of crime by offering emotional 490 assistance, providing resources, and helping the victims 491 navigate the legal process. Sexual assault counselors often work 492 closely with law enforcement agencies, government organizations, 493 and other entities to ensure that the victimsâ rights are upheld 494 and the victimsâ needs are addressed. The personal identifying 495 and location information of sexual assault counselors is 496 frequently documented in police reports or other official 497 records that are provided to a defendant and his or her legal 498 counsel as part of the discovery process. Those documents are 499 subject to public records requests, making the sexual assault 500 counselorsâ personal identifying and location information 501 readily available. The release of this information has led to 502 sexual assault counselors becoming targets of harassment, 503 threats, and retaliation from individuals connected to the cases 504 on which the sexual assault counselors work. The Legislature 505 finds that the release of such personal identifying and location 506 information could place sexual assault counselors in danger of 507 being stalked or physically or emotionally harmed by a defendant 508 or other individual. Therefore, the Legislature finds that the 509 harm that may result from the release of such personal 510 identifying and location information outweighs any public 511 benefit that may be derived from the disclosure of the 512 information. 513 Section 3.âThis act shall take effect July 1, 2026.

Upon receipt of the written request, 442 the custodial agency must release the specified information to 443 the party authorized to receive such information. 444 6.âThe exemptions in this paragraph apply to information 445 held by an agency before, on, or after the effective date of the 446 exemption. 447 7.âInformation made exempt under this paragraph may be 448 disclosed pursuant to s. 28.2221 to a title insurer authorized 449 pursuant to s. 624.401 and its affiliates as defined in s. 450 624.10; a title insurance agent or title insurance agency as 451 defined in s. 626.841(1) or (2), respectively; or an attorney 452 duly admitted to practice law in this state and in good standing 453 with The Florida Bar. 454 8.âThe exempt status of a home address contained in the 455 Official Records is maintained only during the period when a 456 protected party resides at the dwelling location. Upon 457 conveyance of real property after October 1, 2021, and when such 458 real property no longer constitutes a protected partyâs home 459 address as defined in sub-subparagraph 1.a., the protected party 460 must submit a written request to release the removed information 461 to the county recorder. The written request to release the 462 removed information must be notarized, must confirm that a 463 protected partyâs request for release is pursuant to a 464 conveyance of his or her dwelling location, and must specify the 465 Official Records book and page, instrument number, or clerkâs 466 file number for each document containing the information to be 467 released. 468 9.âUpon the death of a protected party as verified by a 469 certified copy of a death certificate or court order, any party 470 can request the county recorder to release a protected 471 decedentâs removed information unless there is a related request 472 on file with the county recorder for continued removal of the 473 decedentâs information or unless such removal is otherwise 474 prohibited by statute or by court order. The written request to 475 release the removed information upon the death of a protected 476 party must attach the certified copy of a death certificate or 477 court order and must be notarized, must confirm the request for 478 release is due to the death of a protected party, and must 479 specify the Official Records book and page number, instrument 480 number, or clerkâs file number for each document containing the 481 information to be released. A fee may not be charged for the 482 release of any document pursuant to such request. 483 Section 2.âThe Legislature finds that it is a public 484 necessity that the home addresses, telephone numbers, dates of 485 birth, and photographs of sexual assault counselors, as defined 486 in s. 90.5035(1), Florida Statutes, be made exempt from s. 487 119.07(1), Florida Statutes, and s. 24(a), Article I of the 488 State Constitution. Sexual assault counselors regularly support 489 individuals who are victims of crime by offering emotional 490 assistance, providing resources, and helping the victims 491 navigate the legal process. Sexual assault counselors often work 492 closely with law enforcement agencies, government organizations, 493 and other entities to ensure that the victimsâ rights are upheld 494 and the victimsâ needs are addressed. The personal identifying 495 and location information of sexual assault counselors is 496 frequently documented in police reports or other official 497 records that are provided to a defendant and his or her legal 498 counsel as part of the discovery process. Those documents are 499 subject to public records requests, making the sexual assault 500 counselorsâ personal identifying and location information 501 readily available. The release of this information has led to 502 sexual assault counselors becoming targets of harassment, 503 threats, and retaliation from individuals connected to the cases 504 on which the sexual assault counselors work. The Legislature 505 finds that the release of such personal identifying and location 506 information could place sexual assault counselors in danger of 507 being stalked or physically or emotionally harmed by a defendant 508 or other individual. Therefore, the Legislature finds that the 509 harm that may result from the release of such personal 510 identifying and location information outweighs any public 511 benefit that may be derived from the disclosure of the 512 information. 513 Section 3.âThis act shall take effect July 1, 2026.
