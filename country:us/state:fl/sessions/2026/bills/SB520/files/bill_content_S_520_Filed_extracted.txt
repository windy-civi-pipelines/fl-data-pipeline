The release of sensitive information included in 54 such records could allow predatory individuals and organizations 55 to take advantage of retirement plan members, payees, and 56 beneficiaries. Exempting this information from public records 57 requirements allows the members, payees, and beneficiaries to 58 invest their funds without the fear of their sensitive 59 information being disclosed without their consent. Additionally, 60 investment plan members, who also participate in the Florida 61 Retirement System, currently have their personal identifying 62 information protected, and this exemption would provide uniform 63 protection of records to all Florida Retirement System members, 64 payees, and beneficiaries regardless of the retirement plan they 65 select. For these reasons, the Legislature finds that it is a 66 public necessity to exempt such information from public records 67 requirements. 68 Section 3.âThis act shall take effect upon becoming a law.
