   20          
   21  Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Florida:

   30         (1)âMANDATORY REPORTING.â
   31         (a)1.âA person is required to report immediately to the
   32  central abuse hotline established in s. 39.101, in writing,
   33  through a call to the toll-free telephone number, or through
   34  electronic reporting, if he or she knows, or has reasonable
   35  cause to suspect, that any of the following has occurred:
   36         a.âChild abuse, abandonment, or neglect by a parent or
   37  caregiver, which includes, but is not limited to, when a child
   38  is abused, abandoned, or neglected by a parent, legal custodian,
   39  caregiver, or other person responsible for the childâs welfare
   40  or when a child is in need of supervision and care and has no
   41  parent, legal custodian, or responsible adult relative
   42  immediately known and available to provide such supervision and
   43  care.
   44         b.âChild abuse by an adult other than a parent, legal
   45  custodian, caregiver, or other person responsible for the
   46  childâs welfare. The central abuse hotline must immediately
   47  electronically transfer such reports to the appropriate county
   48  sheriffâs office <u class="Insert">or local law enforcement agency</u>.
   49         2.âAny person who knows, or has reasonable cause to
   50  suspect, that a child is the victim of sexual abuse or juvenile
   51  sexual abuse shall report such knowledge or suspicion to the
   52  central abuse hotline, including if the alleged incident
   53  involves a child who is in the custody of or under the
   54  protective supervision of the department.
   55         <u class="Insert">3.</u><u class="Insert">â</u><u class="Insert">Any person who knows, or has reasonable cause to</u>
   56  <u class="Insert">suspect, that a child has been born to a parent who has another</u>
   57  <u class="Insert">child who is in the custody of or under the protective</u>
   58  <u class="Insert">supervision of the department shall report such knowledge or</u>
   59  <u class="Insert">suspicion to the central abuse hotline.</u>
   60  
   61  Such reports may be made in writing, through the statewide toll
   62  free telephone number, or through electronic reporting.
   63         (3)âADDITIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES RELATED TO REPORTS.â
   64         <u class="Insert">(f)</u><u class="Insert">â</u><u class="Insert"><i>Children born to certain parents.</i></u><u class="Insert">â</u>
   65         <u class="Insert">1.</u><u class="Insert">â</u><u class="Insert">The central abuse hotline must accept reports alleging</u>
   66  <u class="Insert">that a child has been born to a parent who has another child who</u>
   67  <u class="Insert">is in the custody of or under the protective supervision of the</u>
   68  <u class="Insert">department. Such reports require an immediate onsite protective</u>
   69  <u class="Insert">investigation and the central abuse hotline shall immediately</u>
   70  <u class="Insert">notify the departmentâs designated district staff responsible</u>
   71  <u class="Insert">for protective investigations to ensure that an onsite</u>
   72  <u class="Insert">protective investigation is promptly initiated.</u>
   73         <u class="Insert">2.</u><u class="Insert">â</u><u class="Insert">There is a </u><u class="Insert">rebuttable presumption</u><u class="Insert"> that a child born to a</u>
   74  <u class="Insert">parent who has another child in the custody of or under the</u>
   75  <u class="Insert">protective supervision of the department is in immediate danger</u>
   76  <u class="Insert">of abuse, abandonment, or neglect. A parent may rebut such</u>
   77  <u class="Insert">presumption by providing to the department evidence that the</u>
   78  <u class="Insert">parent is successfully participating in department or court</u>
   79  <u class="Insert">ordered services or other evidence as required by the</u>
   80  <u class="Insert">department.</u>
   81         <u class="Insert">3.</u><u class="Insert">â</u><u class="Insert">If the department determines that the rebuttable</u>
   82  <u class="Insert">presumption has been rebutted and there is not an immediate</u>
   83  <u class="Insert">threat to the childâs well-being or safety, the department must</u>
   84  <u class="Insert">maintain a record that includes any previous allegations,</u>
   85  <u class="Insert">complaints, or petitions against the parent and the evidence</u>
   86  <u class="Insert">that the department relied upon in determining that the parent</u>
   87  <u class="Insert">rebutted the presumption.</u>
   88         <u class="Insert">4.</u><u class="Insert">â</u><u class="Insert">If the presumption is not rebutted and a child is taken</u>
   89  <u class="Insert">into the custody of the department after a protective</u>
   90  <u class="Insert">investigation is conducted under s. 39.301, the department may</u>
   91  <u class="Insert">not return the child to the parentâs custody until all of the</u>
   92  <u class="Insert">following have occurred:</u>
   93         <u class="Insert">a.</u><u class="Insert">â</u><u class="Insert">A guardian ad litem is appointed for the child.</u>
   94         <u class="Insert">b.</u><u class="Insert">â</u><u class="Insert">The department has conducted a full protective</u>
   95  <u class="Insert">investigation pursuant to this chapter and the results of the</u>
   96  <u class="Insert">protective investigation, including any previous allegations,</u>
   97  <u class="Insert">complaints, or petitions of abuse, abandonment, or neglect</u>
   98  <u class="Insert">against the parent, have been presented to the court at the</u>
   99  <u class="Insert">shelter hearing.</u>
  100         <u class="Insert">c.</u><u class="Insert">â</u><u class="Insert">The court determines by a preponderance of the evidence</u>
