  222         1001.42âPowers and duties of district school board.âThe
  223  district school board, acting as a board, shall exercise all
  224  powers and perform all duties listed below:
  225         (8)âSTUDENT WELFARE.â
  226         (c)1.âIn accordance with the rights of parents enumerated
  227  in ss. 1002.20 and 1014.04, adopt procedures for notifying a
  228  studentâs parent if there is a change in the studentâs services
  229  or monitoring related to the studentâs mental, emotional, or
  230  physical health or well-being and the schoolâs ability to
  231  provide a safe and supportive learning environment for the
  232  student. The procedures must reinforce the fundamental right of
  233  parents to make decisions regarding the upbringing and control
  234  of their children by requiring school district personnel to
  235  encourage a student to discuss issues relating to his or her
  236  well-being with his or her parent or to facilitate discussion of
  237  the issue with the parent. The procedures may not prohibit
  238  parents from accessing any of their studentâs education and
  239  health records created, maintained, or used by the school
  240  district, as required by s. 1002.22(2).
  241         2.âA school district may not adopt procedures or student
  242  support forms that prohibit school district personnel from
  243  notifying a parent about his or her studentâs mental, emotional,
  244  or physical health or well-being, or a change in related
  245  services or monitoring, or that encourage or have the effect of
  246  encouraging a student to withhold from a parent such
  247  information. School district personnel may not discourage or
  248  prohibit parental notification of and involvement in critical
  249  decisions affecting a studentâs mental, emotional, or physical
  250  health or well-being. This subparagraph does not prohibit a
  251  school district from adopting procedures that permit school
  252  personnel to withhold such information from a parent if a
  253  reasonably prudent person would believe that disclosure would
  254  result in abuse, abandonment, or neglect, as those terms are
  255  defined in s. 39.01.
  256         3.âClassroom instruction by school personnel or third
  257  parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur
  258  in prekindergarten through grade 8, except when required by ss.
  259  1003.42(2)(o)3. and 1003.46. If such instruction is provided in
  260  grades 9 through 12, the instruction must be age-appropriate or
  261  developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with
  262  state standards. This subparagraph applies to charter schools.
  263         4.âStudent support services training developed or provided
  264  by a school district to school district personnel must adhere to
  265  student services guidelines, standards, and frameworks
  266  established by the Department of Education.
  267         5.âAt the beginning of the school year, each school
  268  district shall notify parents of each health care service
  269  offered at their studentâs school and the option to withhold
  270  consent or decline any specific service in accordance with s.
  271  1014.06. Parental consent to a health care service does not
  272  waive the parentâs right to access his or her studentâs
  273  educational or health records or to be notified about a change
  274  in his or her studentâs services or monitoring as provided by
  275  this paragraph.
