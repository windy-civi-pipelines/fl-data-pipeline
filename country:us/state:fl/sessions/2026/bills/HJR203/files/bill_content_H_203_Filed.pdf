103 (2) An exemption equal to the assessed value of the
104 property to a person who has the legal or equitable title to

126 veteran's permanent, service-connected disability as determined
127 by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. To qualify
128 for the discount granted by this paragraph, an applicant must
129 submit to the county property appraiser, by March 1, an official
130 letter from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs
131 stating the percentage of the veteran's service-connected
132 disability and such evidence that reasonably identifies the
133 disability as combat related and a copy of the veteran's
134 honorable discharge. If the property appraiser denies the
135 request for a discount, the appraiser must notify the applicant
136 in writing of the reasons for the denial, and the veteran may
137 reapply. The Legislature may, by general law, waive the annual
138 application requirement in subsequent years.
139 (2) If a veteran who receives the discount described in
140 paragraph (1) predeceases his or her spouse, and if, upon the
141 death of the veteran, the surviving spouse holds the legal or
142 beneficial title to the homestead property and permanently
143 resides thereon, the discount carries over to the surviving
144 spouse until he or she remarries or sells or otherwise disposes
145 of the homestead property. If the surviving spouse sells or
146 otherwise disposes of the property, a discount not to exceed the
147 dollar amount granted from the most recent ad valorem tax roll
148 may be transferred to the surviving spouse's new homestead
149 property, if used as his or her permanent residence and he or
150 she has not remarried.

151 (3) This subsection is self-executing and does not require
152 implementing legislation.
153 (f) By general law and subject to conditions and
154 limitations specified therein, the Legislature may provide ad
155 valorem tax relief equal to the total amount or a portion of the
156 ad valorem tax otherwise owed on homestead property to:
157 (1) The surviving spouse of a veteran who died from
158 service-connected causes while on active duty as a member of the
159 United States Armed Forces.

161 the line of duty.
162 (3) A first responder who is totally and permanently
163 disabled as a result of an injury or injuries sustained in the
164 line of duty. Causal connection between a disability and service
165 in the line of duty shall not be presumed but must be determined
166 as provided by general law. For purposes of this paragraph, the
167 term "disability" does not include a chronic condition or
168 chronic disease, unless the injury sustained in the line of duty
169 was the sole cause of the chronic condition or chronic disease.
170
171 As used in this subsection and as further defined by general
172 law, the term "first responder" means a law enforcement officer,
173 a correctional officer, a firefighter, an emergency medical
174 technician, or a paramedic, and the term "in the line of duty"
175 means arising out of and in the actual performance of duty
