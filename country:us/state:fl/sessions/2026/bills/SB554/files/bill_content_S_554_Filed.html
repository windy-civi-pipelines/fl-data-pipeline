 2346  against any real property owned by the <u class="Insert">domestic or foreign</u>
 2347  corporation<s class="Remove">, foreign corporation, or alien business organization</s>
 2348  when a certified copy of the judgment or order is recorded as

 7346         (1)âAs used in this section, the term âlimited agricultural
 7347  associationâ or âassociationâ means a limited agricultural
 7348  association formed under ss. 604.09-604.14.
 7349         (2)âA limited agricultural association may convert to a

 7358  617.01201(6).
 7359         (3)âThe certificate of conversion must include:
 7360         (a)âThe date upon which the association was initially
 7361  formed under ss. 604.09-604.14.

 7372         (4)âWhen the certificate of conversion and articles of
 7373  incorporation are filed with the department, or upon the delayed
 7374  effective date, the association is converted to the domestic
 7375  corporation, and the corporation becomes subject to this
 7376  chapter. However, notwithstanding s. 617.0123, the existence of
 7377  the corporation is deemed to have commenced when the association
 7378  was initially formed under ss. 604.09-604.14.
 7379         (5)âConversion of a limited agricultural association to a
 7380  domestic corporation does not affect any obligation or liability
 7381  of the association that was incurred before the conversion.
 7382         (6)âWhen a conversion takes effect under this section, all
 7383  rights, privileges, and powers of the converting association,
 7384  all property, real, personal, and mixed, and all debts due to
 7385  the association, as well as all other assets and causes of
 7386  action belonging to the association, are vested in the domestic
 7387  corporation to which the association is converted and are the
 7388  property of the corporation as they were of the association. The
 7389  title to any real property that is vested by deed or otherwise
 7390  in the converting association does not revert and is not
 7391  impaired by the operation of this chapter, but all rights of
 7392  creditors and all liens upon any property of the association are
 7393  preserved unimpaired, and all debts, liabilities, and duties of
 7394  the association attach to the domestic corporation and are
 7395  enforceable against it to the same extent as if the debts,
 7396  liabilities, and duties had been incurred or contracted by the
 7397  corporation.
 7398         (7)âThe limited agricultural association is not required to
 7399  wind up its affairs or pay its liabilities and distribute its
 7400  assets. Conversion does not constitute a dissolution of the
 7401  association but is a continuation of the associationâs existence
 7402  in the form of the domestic corporation.
 7403         (8)âBefore a limited agricultural association may file a
 7404  certificate of conversion with the department, unless otherwise
 7405  specified in the associationâs articles of association or
 7406  bylaws, the conversion must be approved by a majority vote of
 7407  the associationâs members, and the articles of incorporation
 7408  must be approved by the same authorization required for approval
 7409  of the conversion. As part of the approval, the converting
 7410  association may provide a plan or other record of conversion
 7411  which describes the manner and basis of converting the
 7412  membership interests in the association into membership
 7413  interests in the domestic corporation. The plan or other record
 7414  may also contain other provisions relating to the conversion,
 7415  including, but not limited to, the right of the converting
 7416  association to abandon the proposed conversion or an effective
 7417  date for the conversion that is consistent with paragraph
 7418  (3)(d).

 8057  and any individual licensed under part VIII of chapter 468
 8058  employed by the timeshare management firm, shall discharge its
 8059  duties in good faith, with the care an ordinarily prudent person
 8060  in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances,
 8061  and in a manner it reasonably believes to be in the interests of

 8066  monetary damages in the same manner as provided in s. 617.0834
 8067  unless such officer, director, agent, or firm breached or failed

 8069  its duties constitutes a violation of criminal law as provided
 8070  in s. 617.0834; constitutes a transaction from which the officer
 8071  or director derived an improper personal benefit, either
 8072  directly or indirectly; or constitutes recklessness or an act or
 8073  omission that was in bad faith, with malicious purpose, or in a
 8074  manner exhibiting wanton and willful disregard of human rights,
 8075  safety, or property.
 8076         Section 189.âFor the purpose of incorporating the amendment
