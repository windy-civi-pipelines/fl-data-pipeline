and 3499 2.âComparable to what might have been obtainable in an 3500 armâs length transaction. 3501 (c)ââFamily memberâ includes any of the following: 3502 1.âThe directorâs spouse. 3503 2.âA child, stepchild, parent, stepparent, grandparent, 3504 sibling, step sibling, or half sibling of the director or the 3505 directorâs spouse. 3506 (d)ââIndirect material financial interestâ or âindirectly a 3507 party to a transactionâ means that a directorâs family member 3508 has a material financial interest in the transaction, other than 3509 having an indirect interest as a member of the corporation, or 3510 if the transaction is with an entity, other than the 3511 corporation, which has a material financial interest in the 3512 transaction and controls, or is controlled by, the director or 3513 another person specified in this chapter. 3514 (e)ââIndirect material financial interestâ or âother 3515 material interestâ means a director has a financial or other 3516 interest in the transaction which would reasonably be expected 3517 to impair the objectivity of the directorâs judgment when 3518 participating in the action on the authorization of the 3519 transaction. 3520 (f)ââIndirectly a party to a transactionâ means a director 3521 who has a material financial interest in or is a director, 3522 officer, member, manager, or partner of a person, other than the 3523 corporation, who is a party to the transaction. 3524 (2)âIf a directorâs conflict of interest transaction is 3525 fair to the corporation at the time it is authorized, approved, 3526 effectuated, or ratified: 3527 (a)âSuch transaction is not void or voidable; and 3528 (b)âThe fact that the transaction is a directorâs conflict 3529 of interest transaction is not grounds for any equitable relief, 3530 an award of damages, or other sanctions, because of that 3531 relationship or interest, because such director or directors are 3532 present at the meeting of the board of directors or a committee 3533 thereof which authorizes, approves, or ratifies such 3534 transaction, or because such directors or their votes are 3535 counted for such purpose. 3536 (3)(a)âIn a proceeding challenging the validity of a 3537 directorâs conflict of interest transaction or in a proceeding 3538 seeking equitable relief, award of damages, or other sanctions 3539 with respect to a directorâs conflict of interest transaction, 3540 the person challenging the validity or seeking equitable relief, 3541 award of damages, or other sanctions has the burden of proving 3542 the lack of fairness of the transaction if: 3543 1.âThe material facts of the transaction and the directorâs 3544 interest in the transaction were disclosed or known to the board 3545 of directors or committee that authorizes, approves, or ratifies 3546 the transaction and the transaction was authorized, approved, or 3547 ratified by a vote of a majority of the qualified directors, 3548 even if the qualified directors constitute less than a quorum of 3549 the board or the committee; however, the transaction may not be 3550 authorized, approved, or ratified under this subsection solely 3551 by a single director; or 3552 2.âThe material facts of the transaction and the directorâs 3553 interest in the transaction were disclosed or known to the 3554 members who voted upon such transaction and the transaction was 3555 authorized, approved, or ratified by a majority of the votes 3556 cast by disinterested members or by the written consent of 3557 disinterested members representing a majority of the votes that 3558 could be cast by all disinterested members. A membership 3559 interest owned by or voted under the control of a director who 3560 has a relationship or an interest in the directorâs conflict of 3561 interest transaction may not be considered a membership interest 3562 owned by a disinterested member and may not be counted in a vote 3563 of members to determine whether to authorize, approve, or ratify 3564 a directorâs conflict of interest transaction under this 3565 subsection. The vote of those membership interests, however, is 3566 counted in determining whether the transaction is approved under 3567 other sections of this chapter. A majority of the membership 3568 interests, whether or not present, which are entitled to be 3569 counted in a vote on the transaction under this subsection, 3570 constitutes a quorum for the purpose of taking action under this 3571 section. 3572 (b)âIf neither of the conditions provided in paragraph (a) 3573 have been satisfied, the person defending or asserting the 3574 validity of a directorâs conflict of interest transaction has 3575 the burden of proving its fairness in a proceeding challenging 3576 the validity of the transaction. 3577 (4)âThe presence of or a vote cast by a director with an 3578 interest in the transaction does not affect the validity of an 3579 action taken in paragraph (3)(a) if the transaction is otherwise 3580 authorized, approved, or ratified as provided in subsection (3), 3581 but the presence or vote of the director may be counted for 3582 purposes of determining whether the transaction is approved 3583 under this chapter. 3584 (5)âIn addition to other grounds for challenge, a party 3585 challenging the validity of the transaction is not precluded 3586 from asserting and proving that a particular director or member 3587 was not disinterested on grounds of financial or other interest 3588 for purposes of the vote on, consent to, or approval of the 3589 transaction. 3590 (6)âIf directorsâ action under this section does not 3591 otherwise satisfy a quorum or voting requirement applicable to 3592 the authorization of the transaction by directors as required by 3593 the articles of incorporation, the bylaws, this chapter, or any 3594 other law, an action to satisfy such authorization requirements, 3595 whether as part of the same action or by way of another action, 3596 must be taken by the board of directors or a committee in order 3597 to authorize the transaction. In such action, the vote or 3598 consent of directors who are not disinterested may be counted. 3599 (7)âIf membersâ action under this section does not satisfy 3600 a quorum or voting requirement applicable to the authorization 3601 of the transaction by members as required by the articles of 3602 incorporation, the bylaws, this chapter, or any other law, an 3603 action to satisfy such authorization requirements, whether as 3604 part of the same action or by way of another action, must be 3605 taken by the members in order to authorize the transaction. In 3606 such action, the vote or consent of members who are not 3607 disinterested members may be counted. 3608 Section 52.âSection 617.0834, Florida Statutes, is 3609 reordered and amended to read: 3610 617.0834âLiability of directors and officers and directors 3611 of certain corporations and associations not for profit; 3612 immunity from civil liability.â 3613 (1)âA director or an officer or director of a nonprofit 3614 organization recognized under s. 501(c)(3) or s. 501(c)(4) or s. 3615 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or 3616 of an agricultural or a horticultural organization recognized 3617 under s. 501(c)(5), of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as 3618 amended, is not personally liable for monetary damages to the 3619 corporation or any person for any statement, vote, decision to 3620 take or not, or failure to take an action, or any failure to 3621 take any action, as a director or an officer regarding 3622 organizational management or policy by an officer or director, 3623 unless: 3624 (a)âThe director or officer or director breached or failed 3625 to perform the directorâs or officerâs his or her duties as a 3626 director or an officer or director; and 3627 (b)âThe directorâs or officerâs or directorâs breach of, or 3628 failure to perform, the directorâs or officerâs his or her 3629 duties constitutes any of the following: 3630 1.âA violation of the criminal law, unless the officer or 3631 director or officer had reasonable cause to believe the 3632 directorâs or officerâs his or her conduct was lawful or had no 3633 reasonable cause to believe the directorâs or officerâs his or 3634 her conduct was unlawful. A judgment or other final adjudication 3635 against a director or an officer or director in any criminal 3636 proceeding for violation of the criminal law estops that 3637 director or officer or director from contesting the fact that 3638 the directorâs or officerâs his or her breach, or failure to 3639 perform, constitutes a violation of the criminal law, but does 3640 not estop the director or officer or director from establishing 3641 that the director or officer he or she had reasonable cause to 3642 believe that the directorâs or officerâs his or her conduct was 3643 lawful or had no reasonable cause to believe that the directorâs 3644 or officerâs his or her conduct was unlawful;

and 3674 2.âKnown to the director or officer or director, or so 3675 obvious that it should have been known, to be so great as to 3676 make it highly probable that harm would follow from such action 3677 or omission. 3678 (a)(b)ââDirectorâ means a person who serves as a director, 3679 trustee, or member of the governing board of an organization. 3680 (b)(c)ââOfficerâ means a person who serves as an officer 3681 without compensation except reimbursement for actual expenses 3682 incurred or to be incurred. 3683 Section 53.âSubsection (4) of section 617.0835, Florida 3684 Statutes, is amended to read: 3685 617.0835âProhibited activities by private foundations.â 3686 (4)âThe provisions of Subsections (2) and (3) do not apply 3687 to any corporation that was incorporated before January 1, 1970, 3688 and that has been properly relieved from the requirements of 26 3689 U.S.C. s. 508(e)(1) by a timely judicial proceeding to the 3690 extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines that 3691 such application would be contrary to the terms of the articles 3692 of incorporation or organization or other instrument governing 3693 such corporation or governing the administration of charitable 3694 funds held by it and that the same may not properly be changed 3695 to conform to such subsections. 3696 Section 54.âSection 617.0844, Florida Statutes, is created 3697 to read: 3698 617.0844âStandards of conduct for officers.â 3699 (1)âAn officer, when discharging his or her duties, shall 3700 act: 3701 (a)âIn good faith;

and 3499 2.âComparable to what might have been obtainable in an 3500 armâs length transaction. 3501 (c)ââFamily memberâ includes any of the following: 3502 1.âThe directorâs spouse. 3503 2.âA child, stepchild, parent, stepparent, grandparent, 3504 sibling, step sibling, or half sibling of the director or the 3505 directorâs spouse. 3506 (d)ââIndirect material financial interestâ or âindirectly a 3507 party to a transactionâ means that a directorâs family member 3508 has a material financial interest in the transaction, other than 3509 having an indirect interest as a member of the corporation, or 3510 if the transaction is with an entity, other than the 3511 corporation, which has a material financial interest in the 3512 transaction and controls, or is controlled by, the director or 3513 another person specified in this chapter. 3514 (e)ââIndirect material financial interestâ or âother 3515 material interestâ means a director has a financial or other 3516 interest in the transaction which would reasonably be expected 3517 to impair the objectivity of the directorâs judgment when 3518 participating in the action on the authorization of the 3519 transaction. 3520 (f)ââIndirectly a party to a transactionâ means a director 3521 who has a material financial interest in or is a director, 3522 officer, member, manager, or partner of a person, other than the 3523 corporation, who is a party to the transaction. 3524 (2)âIf a directorâs conflict of interest transaction is 3525 fair to the corporation at the time it is authorized, approved, 3526 effectuated, or ratified: 3527 (a)âSuch transaction is not void or voidable; and 3528 (b)âThe fact that the transaction is a directorâs conflict 3529 of interest transaction is not grounds for any equitable relief, 3530 an award of damages, or other sanctions, because of that 3531 relationship or interest, because such director or directors are 3532 present at the meeting of the board of directors or a committee 3533 thereof which authorizes, approves, or ratifies such 3534 transaction, or because such directors or their votes are 3535 counted for such purpose. 3536 (3)(a)âIn a proceeding challenging the validity of a 3537 directorâs conflict of interest transaction or in a proceeding 3538 seeking equitable relief, award of damages, or other sanctions 3539 with respect to a directorâs conflict of interest transaction, 3540 the person challenging the validity or seeking equitable relief, 3541 award of damages, or other sanctions has the burden of proving 3542 the lack of fairness of the transaction if: 3543 1.âThe material facts of the transaction and the directorâs 3544 interest in the transaction were disclosed or known to the board 3545 of directors or committee that authorizes, approves, or ratifies 3546 the transaction and the transaction was authorized, approved, or 3547 ratified by a vote of a majority of the qualified directors, 3548 even if the qualified directors constitute less than a quorum of 3549 the board or the committee; however, the transaction may not be 3550 authorized, approved, or ratified under this subsection solely 3551 by a single director; or 3552 2.âThe material facts of the transaction and the directorâs 3553 interest in the transaction were disclosed or known to the 3554 members who voted upon such transaction and the transaction was 3555 authorized, approved, or ratified by a majority of the votes 3556 cast by disinterested members or by the written consent of 3557 disinterested members representing a majority of the votes that 3558 could be cast by all disinterested members. A membership 3559 interest owned by or voted under the control of a director who 3560 has a relationship or an interest in the directorâs conflict of 3561 interest transaction may not be considered a membership interest 3562 owned by a disinterested member and may not be counted in a vote 3563 of members to determine whether to authorize, approve, or ratify 3564 a directorâs conflict of interest transaction under this 3565 subsection. The vote of those membership interests, however, is 3566 counted in determining whether the transaction is approved under 3567 other sections of this chapter. A majority of the membership 3568 interests, whether or not present, which are entitled to be 3569 counted in a vote on the transaction under this subsection, 3570 constitutes a quorum for the purpose of taking action under this 3571 section. 3572 (b)âIf neither of the conditions provided in paragraph (a) 3573 have been satisfied, the person defending or asserting the 3574 validity of a directorâs conflict of interest transaction has 3575 the burden of proving its fairness in a proceeding challenging 3576 the validity of the transaction. 3577 (4)âThe presence of or a vote cast by a director with an 3578 interest in the transaction does not affect the validity of an 3579 action taken in paragraph (3)(a) if the transaction is otherwise 3580 authorized, approved, or ratified as provided in subsection (3), 3581 but the presence or vote of the director may be counted for 3582 purposes of determining whether the transaction is approved 3583 under this chapter. 3584 (5)âIn addition to other grounds for challenge, a party 3585 challenging the validity of the transaction is not precluded 3586 from asserting and proving that a particular director or member 3587 was not disinterested on grounds of financial or other interest 3588 for purposes of the vote on, consent to, or approval of the 3589 transaction. 3590 (6)âIf directorsâ action under this section does not 3591 otherwise satisfy a quorum or voting requirement applicable to 3592 the authorization of the transaction by directors as required by 3593 the articles of incorporation, the bylaws, this chapter, or any 3594 other law, an action to satisfy such authorization requirements, 3595 whether as part of the same action or by way of another action, 3596 must be taken by the board of directors or a committee in order 3597 to authorize the transaction. In such action, the vote or 3598 consent of directors who are not disinterested may be counted. 3599 (7)âIf membersâ action under this section does not satisfy 3600 a quorum or voting requirement applicable to the authorization 3601 of the transaction by members as required by the articles of 3602 incorporation, the bylaws, this chapter, or any other law, an 3603 action to satisfy such authorization requirements, whether as 3604 part of the same action or by way of another action, must be 3605 taken by the members in order to authorize the transaction. In 3606 such action, the vote or consent of members who are not 3607 disinterested members may be counted. 3608 Section 52.âSection 617.0834, Florida Statutes, is 3609 reordered and amended to read: 3610 617.0834âLiability of directors and officers and directors 3611 of certain corporations and associations not for profit; 3612 immunity from civil liability.â 3613 (1)âA director or an officer or director of a nonprofit 3614 organization recognized under s. 501(c)(3) or s. 501(c)(4) or s. 3615 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or 3616 of an agricultural or a horticultural organization recognized 3617 under s. 501(c)(5), of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as 3618 amended, is not personally liable for monetary damages to the 3619 corporation or any person for any statement, vote, decision to 3620 take or not, or failure to take an action, or any failure to 3621 take any action, as a director or an officer regarding 3622 organizational management or policy by an officer or director, 3623 unless: 3624 (a)âThe director or officer or director breached or failed 3625 to perform the directorâs or officerâs his or her duties as a 3626 director or an officer or director; and 3627 (b)âThe directorâs or officerâs or directorâs breach of, or 3628 failure to perform, the directorâs or officerâs his or her 3629 duties constitutes any of the following: 3630 1.âA violation of the criminal law, unless the officer or 3631 director or officer had reasonable cause to believe the 3632 directorâs or officerâs his or her conduct was lawful or had no 3633 reasonable cause to believe the directorâs or officerâs his or 3634 her conduct was unlawful. A judgment or other final adjudication 3635 against a director or an officer or director in any criminal 3636 proceeding for violation of the criminal law estops that 3637 director or officer or director from contesting the fact that 3638 the directorâs or officerâs his or her breach, or failure to 3639 perform, constitutes a violation of the criminal law, but does 3640 not estop the director or officer or director from establishing 3641 that the director or officer he or she had reasonable cause to 3642 believe that the directorâs or officerâs his or her conduct was 3643 lawful or had no reasonable cause to believe that the directorâs 3644 or officerâs his or her conduct was unlawful;

and 3674 2.âKnown to the director or officer or director, or so 3675 obvious that it should have been known, to be so great as to 3676 make it highly probable that harm would follow from such action 3677 or omission. 3678 (a)(b)ââDirectorâ means a person who serves as a director, 3679 trustee, or member of the governing board of an organization. 3680 (b)(c)ââOfficerâ means a person who serves as an officer 3681 without compensation except reimbursement for actual expenses 3682 incurred or to be incurred. 3683 Section 53.âSubsection (4) of section 617.0835, Florida 3684 Statutes, is amended to read: 3685 617.0835âProhibited activities by private foundations.â 3686 (4)âThe provisions of Subsections (2) and (3) do not apply 3687 to any corporation that was incorporated before January 1, 1970, 3688 and that has been properly relieved from the requirements of 26 3689 U.S.C. s. 508(e)(1) by a timely judicial proceeding to the 3690 extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines that 3691 such application would be contrary to the terms of the articles 3692 of incorporation or organization or other instrument governing 3693 such corporation or governing the administration of charitable 3694 funds held by it and that the same may not properly be changed 3695 to conform to such subsections. 3696 Section 54.âSection 617.0844, Florida Statutes, is created 3697 to read: 3698 617.0844âStandards of conduct for officers.â 3699 (1)âAn officer, when discharging his or her duties, shall 3700 act: 3701 (a)âIn good faith;
