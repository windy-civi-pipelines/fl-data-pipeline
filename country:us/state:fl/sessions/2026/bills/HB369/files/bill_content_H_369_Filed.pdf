453 advance directives, orders not to resuscitate executed pursuant
454 to s. 401.45, or patient-directed medical orders executed
455 pursuant to s. 765.3041 which contain an order not to

461 pursuant to s. 401.45, or a patient-directed medical order

476 (3) The surrogate's authority commences either upon a
477 determination under subsection (2) that the principal lacks
478 capacity or upon a stipulation of such authority pursuant to s.
479 765.101 s. 765.101(21). Such authority remains in effect until a
480 determination that the principal has regained such capacity, if
481 the authority commenced as a result of incapacity, or until the
482 authority is revoked, if the authority commenced immediately
483 pursuant to s. 765.101 s. 765.101(21). Upon commencement of the
484 surrogate's authority, a surrogate who is not the principal's
485 spouse shall notify the principal's spouse or adult children of
486 the principal's designation of the surrogate. Except if the
487 principal provided immediately exercisable authority to the
488 surrogate pursuant to s. 765.101 s. 765.101(21), in the event
489 that the primary or attending physician determines that the
490 principal has regained capacity, the authority of the surrogate
491 shall cease, but recommences if the principal subsequently loses
492 capacity as determined pursuant to this section. A health care
493 provider is not liable for relying upon health care decisions
494 made by a surrogate while the principal lacks capacity. At any
495 time when a principal lacks capacity, a health care decision
496 made on the principal's behalf by a surrogate is effective to
497 the same extent as a decision made by the principal. If a
498 principal possesses capacity, health care decisions of the
499 principal take precedence over decisions made by the surrogate
500 that present a material conflict.

524 exercised by the patient.
