128 at the time of the shooting, and
129 WHEREAS, the state attorney's office for the Seventeenth

131 Maldonado's violations were "serious" and should have been
132 reported by the Department of Corrections to the state attorney

151 without a legal or administrative remedy for his claim, and

153 is without a legal remedy, Florida legislative precedent dating
154 back to 1831, as stated in the Legislative Claim Bill Manual
155 (2022), defines a claim bill to be "a means by which an injured
156 party may recover damages even though the public officer or
157 agency involved may be immune from suit," and
158 WHEREAS, the Florida Supreme Court and appellate courts
159 acknowledge relief for "equitable claims filed without an
160 underlying excess judgment" or settlement, and the far-reaching

165 (Fla. 1984), holding that any claim bill, whether based on an
166 existing judgment, a settlement, or an equitable claim, is an
167 "act of legislative grace" and "a voluntary recognition of its
168 moral obligation by the legislature," and is "firmly entrenched
169 in legislative discretion"; Searcy Denney, et al. vs. State of
170 Fla., 209 So.3d 1181 (Fla. 2017), citing Noel v. Schlesinger,

175 obligation to any individual or entity whom or which the

176 legislature recognizes as being entitled to such"; and Jetton v.
177 Jacksonville Electric Authority, 399 So.2d 396, 397 (Fla. 1st
178 DCA 1981), holding that while the Legislature has placed limits
179 on recovery, "claimants remain free to seek legislative relief
180 bills, as they did during days of complete sovereign immunity,"
181 and
182 WHEREAS, the facts as set forth herein establish that the
183 Department of Corrections failed to follow state law,
184 regulations, and policies and take action to prevent a convicted
185 felon on probation from possessing a weapon; to enforce numerous
186 other serious and willful probation violations committed by a
187 probationer who falsely claimed to be a United States Marine;
188 and to supervise, investigate, enforce, and report any of these
189 probation violations to the state attorney and presiding circuit
190 judge as required by law, and
191 WHEREAS, this claim bill is supported by the Broward County
192 Sheriff's Office, the Florida Police Benevolent Association, and
193 the International Union of Police Associations, and
194 WHEREAS, given the unique and tragic circumstances of this
195 case, including the attempted murder and permanent disability of
196 a sworn Florida police officer who was critically and
197 permanently injured in the line of duty, Deputy Hernandez is
198 deserving of legislative grace and the Legislature's exercise of
199 its exclusive authority to appropriate funds to compensate him

128 at the time of the shooting, and
129 WHEREAS, the state attorney's office for the Seventeenth

131 Maldonado's violations were "serious" and should have been
132 reported by the Department of Corrections to the state attorney
133 and the presiding circuit judge and, had Mr. Maldonado's
134 violations been reported, he would have been jailed without bail
135 and would not have been on the streets when he shot Deputy
136 Hernandez, and
137 WHEREAS, after the shooting, the Department of Corrections
138 announced that Mr. Maldonado's probation file had been turned
139 over to the department's Office of Inspector General for review,
140 but no report or any record of a department review exist, nor to

151 without a legal or administrative remedy for his claim, and
152 WHEREAS, despite the court's ruling that Deputy Hernandez
153 is without a legal remedy, Florida legislative precedent dating
154 back to 1831, as stated in the Legislative Claim Bill Manual

163 agency may be immune from suit, and
164 WHEREAS, these cases include Gamble v. Wells, 450 So.2d 850
165 (Fla. 1984), holding that any claim bill, whether based on an
166 existing judgment, a settlement, or an equitable claim, is an
167 "act of legislative grace" and "a voluntary recognition of its
168 moral obligation by the legislature," and is "firmly entrenched
169 in legislative discretion"; Searcy Denney, et al. vs. State of
170 Fla., 209 So.3d 1181 (Fla. 2017), citing Noel v. Schlesinger,

172 supra; Dickinson v. Bradley, 298 So.2d 352 (Fla. 1974), in which
173 the Florida Supreme Court stated that the "purpose" of any

177 Jacksonville Electric Authority, 399 So.2d 396, 397 (Fla. 1st

179 on recovery, "claimants remain free to seek legislative relief
180 bills, as they did during days of complete sovereign immunity,"
181 and
182 WHEREAS, the facts as set forth herein establish that the
183 Department of Corrections failed to follow state law,
184 regulations, and policies and take action to prevent a convicted
185 felon on probation from possessing a weapon; to enforce numerous
186 other serious and willful probation violations committed by a
187 probationer who falsely claimed to be a United States Marine;
188 and to supervise, investigate, enforce, and report any of these
189 probation violations to the state attorney and presiding circuit
190 judge as required by law, and
191 WHEREAS, this claim bill is supported by the Broward County
192 Sheriff's Office, the Florida Police Benevolent Association, and

195 case, including the attempted murder and permanent disability of
196 a sworn Florida police officer who was critically and
197 permanently injured in the line of duty, Deputy Hernandez is
198 deserving of legislative grace and the Legislature's exercise of
