37 residents in North West Miami-Dade County and South West Broward
38 County, who have reported property damage resulting from ground
39 vibrations caused by nearby limestone mining operations.

41 and equitable remedy for property owners who can prove that
42 their property damage was caused by nearby limestone mining
43 operations.
