The report furnished to the domestic violence center 537 must include a narrative description of the dating violence 538 incident. 539 (13)âWhenever a law enforcement officer determines upon 540 probable cause that an act of dating violence has been committed 541 within the jurisdiction, or that a person has violated a 542 condition of pretrial release as provided in s. 903.047 and the 543 original arrest was for an act of dating violence, the officer 544 may arrest the person or persons suspected of its commission and 545 charge such person or persons with the appropriate crime. The 546 decision to arrest and charge does shall not require consent of 547 the victim or consideration of the relationship of the parties. 548 (14)(a)âWhen complaints are received from two or more 549 parties, the officers shall evaluate each complaint separately 550 to determine whether there is probable cause for arrest. 551 (b)âIf a law enforcement officer has probable cause to 552 believe that two or more persons have committed a misdemeanor or 553 felony, or if two or more persons make complaints to the 554 officer, the officer must shall try to determine who was the 555 primary aggressor. Arrest is the preferred response only with 556 respect to the primary aggressor and not the preferred response 557 with respect to a person who acts in a reasonable manner to 558 protect or defend himself or herself or another family or 559 household member from dating violence. 560 (15)âA person who willfully violates a condition of 561 pretrial release provided in s. 903.047, when the original 562 arrest was for an act of dating violence as defined in this 563 section, commits a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable 564 as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083, and shall be held in 565 custody until his or her first appearance. 566 (16)âA law enforcement officer acting in good faith under 567 this section and the officerâs employing agency shall be immune 568 from all liability, civil or criminal, that might otherwise be 569 incurred or imposed by reason of the officerâs or agencyâs 570 actions in carrying out the provisions of this section. 571 Section 2.âParagraph (a) of subsection (5) of section 572 44.407, Florida Statutes, is amended to read: 573 44.407âElder-focused dispute resolution process.â 574 (5)âQUALIFICATIONS FOR ELDERCARING COORDINATORS.â 575 (a)âThe court shall appoint qualified eldercaring 576 coordinators who: 577 1.âMeet one of the following professional requirements: 578 a.âAre licensed as a mental health professional under 579 chapter 491 and hold at least a masterâs degree in the 580 professional field of practice; 581 b.âAre licensed as a psychologist under chapter 490; 582 c.âAre licensed as a physician under chapter 458 or chapter 583 459; 584 d.âAre licensed as a nurse under chapter 464 and hold at 585 least a masterâs degree; 586 e.âAre certified by the Florida Supreme Court as a family 587 mediator and hold at least a masterâs degree; 588 f.âAre a member in good standing of The Florida Bar; or 589 g.âAre a professional guardian as defined in s. 744.102(17) 590 and hold at least a masterâs degree. 591 2.âHave completed all of the following: 592 a.âThree years of postlicensure or postcertification 593 practice; 594 b.âA family mediation training program certified by the 595 Florida Supreme Court; and 596 c.âAn eldercaring coordinator training program certified by 597 the Florida Supreme Court. The training must total at least 44 598 hours and must include advanced tactics for dispute resolution 599 of issues related to aging, illness, incapacity, or other 600 vulnerabilities associated with elders, as well as elder, 601 guardianship, and incapacity law and procedures and less 602 restrictive alternatives to guardianship; phases of eldercaring 603 coordination and the role and functions of an eldercaring 604 coordinator; the elderâs role within eldercaring coordination; 605 family dynamics related to eldercaring coordination; eldercaring 606 coordination skills and techniques; multicultural competence and 607 its use in eldercaring coordination; at least 6 hours of the 608 implications of elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation and other 609 safety issues pertinent to the training; at least 4 hours of 610 ethical considerations pertaining to the training; use of 611 technology within eldercaring coordination; and court-specific 612 eldercaring coordination procedures. Pending certification of a 613 training program by the Florida Supreme Court, the eldercaring 614 coordinator must document completion of training that satisfies 615 the hours and the elements prescribed in this sub-subparagraph. 616 3.âHave successfully passed a Level 2 background screening 617 as provided in s. 435.04(2) and (3) or are exempt from 618 disqualification under s. 435.07. The prospective eldercaring 619 coordinator must submit a full set of fingerprints to the court 620 or to a vendor, entity, or agency authorized by s. 943.053(13). 621 The court, vendor, entity, or agency shall forward the 622 fingerprints to the Department of Law Enforcement for state 623 processing, and the Department of Law Enforcement shall forward 624 the fingerprints to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for 625 national processing. The prospective eldercaring coordinator 626 shall pay the fees for state and federal fingerprint processing. 627 The state cost for fingerprint processing shall be as provided 628 in s. 943.053(3)(e) for records provided to persons or entities 629 other than those specified as exceptions therein. 630 4.âHave not been a respondent in a final order granting an 631 injunction for protection against domestic violence, dating 632 violence, sexual violence, or repeat violence, serious violence 633 by a known person, or stalking or exploitation of an elder or a 634 disabled person. 635 5.âHave met any additional qualifications the court may 636 require to address issues specific to the parties. 637 Section 3.âParagraph (c) of subsection (2) of section 638 61.13, Florida Statutes, is amended to read 639 61.13âSupport of children; parenting and time-sharing; 640 powers of court.â 641 (2) 642 (c)âThe court shall determine all matters relating to 643 parenting and time-sharing of each minor child of the parties in 644 accordance with the best interests of the child and in 645 accordance with the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and 646 Enforcement Act, except that modification of a parenting plan 647 and time-sharing schedule requires a showing of a substantial 648 and material change of circumstances. 649 1.âIt is the public policy of this state that each minor 650 child has frequent and continuing contact with both parents 651 after the parents separate or the marriage of the parties is 652 dissolved and to encourage parents to share the rights and 653 responsibilities, and joys, of childrearing. Unless otherwise 654 provided in this section or agreed to by the parties, there is a 655 rebuttable presumption that equal time-sharing of a minor child 656 is in the best interests of the minor child. To rebut this 657 presumption, a party must prove by a preponderance of the 658 evidence that equal time-sharing is not in the best interests of 659 the minor child. Except when a time-sharing schedule is agreed 660 to by the parties and approved by the court, the court must 661 evaluate all of the factors set forth in subsection (3) and make 662 specific written findings of fact when creating or modifying a 663 time-sharing schedule. 664 2.âThe court shall order that the parental responsibility 665 for a minor child be shared by both parents unless the court 666 finds that shared parental responsibility would be detrimental 667 to the child. In determining detriment to the child, the court 668 shall consider: 669 a.âEvidence of domestic violence, as defined in s. 741.28; 670 b.âWhether either parent has or has had reasonable cause to 671 believe that he or she or his or her minor child or children are 672 or have been in imminent danger of becoming victims of an act of 673 domestic violence as defined in s. 741.28 or sexual violence as 674 defined in s. 784.046(1) s. 784.046(1)(c) by the other parent 675 against the parent or against the child or children whom the 676 parents share in common regardless of whether a cause of action 677 has been brought or is currently pending in the court; 678 c.âWhether either parent has or has had reasonable cause to 679 believe that his or her minor child or children are or have been 680 in imminent danger of becoming victims of an act of abuse, 681 abandonment, or neglect, as those terms are defined in s. 39.01, 682 by the other parent against the child or children whom the 683 parents share in common regardless of whether a cause of action 684 has been brought or is currently pending in the court; and 685 d.âAny other relevant factors. 686 3.âThe following evidence creates a rebuttable presumption 687 that shared parental responsibility is detrimental to the child: 688 a.âA parent has been convicted of a misdemeanor of the 689 first degree or higher involving domestic violence, as defined 690 in s. 741.28 and chapter 775; 691 b.âA parent meets the criteria of s. 39.806(1)(d); or 692 c.âA parent has been convicted of or had adjudication 693 withheld for an offense enumerated in s. 943.0435(1)(h)1.a., and 694 at the time of the offense: 695 (I)âThe parent was 18 years of age or older. 696 (II)âThe victim was under 18 years of age or the parent 697 believed the victim to be under 18 years of age. 698 699 If the presumption is not rebutted after the convicted parent is 700 advised by the court that the presumption exists, shared 701 parental responsibility, including time-sharing with the child, 702 and decisions made regarding the child, may not be granted to 703 the convicted parent. However, the convicted parent is not 704 relieved of any obligation to provide financial support. If the 705 court determines that shared parental responsibility would be 706 detrimental to the child, it may order sole parental 707 responsibility and make such arrangements for time-sharing as 708 specified in the parenting plan as will best protect the child 709 or abused spouse from further harm. Whether or not there is a 710 conviction of any offense of domestic violence or child abuse or 711 the existence of an injunction for protection against domestic 712 violence, the court shall consider evidence of domestic violence 713 or child abuse as evidence of detriment to the child. 714 4.âIn ordering shared parental responsibility, the court 715 may consider the expressed desires of the parents and may grant 716 to one party the ultimate responsibility over specific aspects 717 of the childâs welfare or may divide those responsibilities 718 between the parties based on the best interests of the child. 719 Areas of responsibility may include education, health care, and 720 any other responsibilities that the court finds unique to a 721 particular family. 722 5.âThe court shall order sole parental responsibility for a 723 minor child to one parent, with or without time-sharing with the 724 other parent if it is in the best interests of the minor child. 725 6.âThere is a rebuttable presumption against granting time 726 sharing with a minor child if a parent has been convicted of or 727 had adjudication withheld for an offense enumerated in s. 728 943.0435(1)(h)1.a., and at the time of the offense: 729 a.âThe parent was 18 years of age or older. 730 b.âThe victim was under 18 years of age or the parent 731 believed the victim to be under 18 years of age. 732 733 A parent may rebut the presumption upon a specific finding in 734 writing by the court that the parent poses no significant risk 735 of harm to the child and that time-sharing is in the best 736 interests of the minor child. If the presumption is rebutted, 737 the court must consider all time-sharing factors in subsection 738 (3) when developing a time-sharing schedule. 739 7.âAccess to records and information pertaining to a minor 740 child, including, but not limited to, medical, dental, and 741 school records, may not be denied to either parent. Full rights 742 under this subparagraph apply to either parent unless a court 743 order specifically revokes these rights, including any 744 restrictions on these rights as provided in a domestic violence 745 injunction. A parent having rights under this subparagraph has 746 the same rights upon request as to form, substance, and manner 747 of access as are available to the other parent of a child, 748 including, without limitation, the right to in-person 749 communication with medical, dental, and education providers. 750 Section 4.âParagraph (a) of subsection (3) of section 751 61.1825, Florida Statutes, is amended to read: 752 61.1825âState Case Registry.â 753 (3)(a)âFor the purpose of this section, a family violence 754 indicator must be placed on a record when: 755 1.âA party executes a sworn statement requesting that a 756 family violence indicator be placed on that partyâs record which 757 states that the party has reason to believe that release of 758 information to the Federal Case Registry may result in physical 759 or emotional harm to the party or the child; or 760 2.âA temporary or final injunction for protection against 761 domestic violence has been granted pursuant to s. 741.30(6), an 762 injunction for protection against domestic violence has been 763 issued by a court of a foreign state pursuant to s. 741.315, or 764 a temporary or final injunction for protection against repeat 765 violence has been granted pursuant to s. 784.046;

In addition, if the sheriff is in possession of an 364 injunction for protection that has been certified by the clerk 365 of the court, the sheriff may electronically transmit a copy of 366 that injunction to a law enforcement officer who shall serve it 367 in the same manner as a certified copy. The clerk of the court 368 is responsible for furnishing to the sheriff such information on 369 the respondentâs physical description and location as is 370 required by the department to comply with the verification 371 procedures set forth in this section. Notwithstanding any other 372 law to the contrary, the chief judge of each circuit, in 373 consultation with the appropriate sheriff, may authorize a law 374 enforcement agency within the chief judgeâs jurisdiction to 375 effect this type of service and to receive a portion of the 376 service fee.

On a 460 monthly basis, the clerk shall transfer the moneys collected 461 pursuant to this paragraph to the State Treasury for deposit in 462 the Crimes Compensation Trust Fund established in s. 960.21. 463 (b)âIf the respondent is arrested by a law enforcement 464 officer under s. 901.15(6) for committing an act of repeat 465 violence, sexual violence, or dating violence, or serious 466 violence by a known person in violation of an injunction for 467 protection, the respondent must shall be held in custody until 468 brought before the court as expeditiously as possible for the 469 purpose of enforcing the injunction and for admittance to bail 470 in accordance with chapter 903 and the applicable rules of 471 criminal procedure, pending a hearing. 472 (10)âThe petitioner or the respondent may move the court to 473 modify or dissolve an injunction at any time. 474 (11)âAny law enforcement officer who investigates an 475 alleged incident of dating violence shall assist the victim to 476 obtain medical treatment if such is required as a result of the 477 alleged incident to which the officer responds. Any law 478 enforcement officer who investigates an alleged incident of 479 dating violence shall advise the victim of such violence that 480 there is a domestic violence center from which the victim may 481 receive services.

Whether or not an arrest is 511 made, the officer shall make a written police report that is 512 complete and clearly indicates that the alleged offense was an 513 incident of dating violence. Such report must shall be given to 514 the officerâs supervisor and filed with the law enforcement 515 agency in a manner that will permit data on dating violence 516 cases to be compiled. Such report must include: 517 (a)âA description of physical injuries observed, if any. 518 (b)âIf a law enforcement officer decides not to make an 519 arrest or decides to arrest two or more parties, the grounds for 520 not arresting anyone or for arresting two or more parties. 521 (c)âA statement indicating which indicates that a copy of 522 the legal rights and remedies notice was given to the victim. 523 524 Whenever possible, the law enforcement officer shall obtain a 525 written statement from the victim and witnesses concerning the 526 alleged dating violence. The officer shall submit the report to 527 the supervisor or other person to whom the employerâs rules or 528 policies require reports of similar allegations of criminal 529 activity to be made. The law enforcement agency shall, without 530 charge, send a copy of the initial police report, as well as any 531 subsequent, supplemental, or related report, which excludes 532 victim or witness statements or other materials that are part of 533 an active criminal investigation and are exempt from disclosure 534 under chapter 119, to the nearest locally certified domestic 535 violence center within 24 hours after the agencyâs receipt of 536 the report. The report furnished to the domestic violence center 537 must include a narrative description of the dating violence 538 incident. 539 (13)âWhenever a law enforcement officer determines upon 540 probable cause that an act of dating violence has been committed 541 within the jurisdiction, or that a person has violated a 542 condition of pretrial release as provided in s. 903.047 and the 543 original arrest was for an act of dating violence, the officer 544 may arrest the person or persons suspected of its commission and 545 charge such person or persons with the appropriate crime.

Arrest is the preferred response only with 556 respect to the primary aggressor and not the preferred response 557 with respect to a person who acts in a reasonable manner to 558 protect or defend himself or herself or another family or 559 household member from dating violence. 560 (15)âA person who willfully violates a condition of 561 pretrial release provided in s. 903.047, when the original 562 arrest was for an act of dating violence as defined in this 563 section, commits a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable 564 as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083, and shall be held in 565 custody until his or her first appearance. 566 (16)âA law enforcement officer acting in good faith under 567 this section and the officerâs employing agency shall be immune 568 from all liability, civil or criminal, that might otherwise be 569 incurred or imposed by reason of the officerâs or agencyâs 570 actions in carrying out the provisions of this section. 571 Section 2.âParagraph (a) of subsection (5) of section 572 44.407, Florida Statutes, is amended to read: 573 44.407âElder-focused dispute resolution process.â 574 (5)âQUALIFICATIONS FOR ELDERCARING COORDINATORS.â 575 (a)âThe court shall appoint qualified eldercaring 576 coordinators who: 577 1.âMeet one of the following professional requirements: 578 a.âAre licensed as a mental health professional under 579 chapter 491 and hold at least a masterâs degree in the 580 professional field of practice; 581 b.âAre licensed as a psychologist under chapter 490; 582 c.âAre licensed as a physician under chapter 458 or chapter 583 459; 584 d.âAre licensed as a nurse under chapter 464 and hold at 585 least a masterâs degree; 586 e.âAre certified by the Florida Supreme Court as a family 587 mediator and hold at least a masterâs degree; 588 f.âAre a member in good standing of The Florida Bar; or 589 g.âAre a professional guardian as defined in s. 744.102(17) 590 and hold at least a masterâs degree. 591 2.âHave completed all of the following: 592 a.âThree years of postlicensure or postcertification 593 practice; 594 b.âA family mediation training program certified by the 595 Florida Supreme Court; and 596 c.âAn eldercaring coordinator training program certified by 597 the Florida Supreme Court.

Pending certification of a 613 training program by the Florida Supreme Court, the eldercaring 614 coordinator must document completion of training that satisfies 615 the hours and the elements prescribed in this sub-subparagraph. 616 3.âHave successfully passed a Level 2 background screening 617 as provided in s. 435.04(2) and (3) or are exempt from 618 disqualification under s. 435.07. The prospective eldercaring 619 coordinator must submit a full set of fingerprints to the court 620 or to a vendor, entity, or agency authorized by s. 943.053(13). 621 The court, vendor, entity, or agency shall forward the 622 fingerprints to the Department of Law Enforcement for state 623 processing, and the Department of Law Enforcement shall forward 624 the fingerprints to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for 625 national processing. The prospective eldercaring coordinator 626 shall pay the fees for state and federal fingerprint processing. 627 The state cost for fingerprint processing shall be as provided 628 in s. 943.053(3)(e) for records provided to persons or entities 629 other than those specified as exceptions therein. 630 4.âHave not been a respondent in a final order granting an 631 injunction for protection against domestic violence, dating 632 violence, sexual violence, or repeat violence, serious violence 633 by a known person, or stalking or exploitation of an elder or a 634 disabled person. 635 5.âHave met any additional qualifications the court may 636 require to address issues specific to the parties. 637 Section 3.âParagraph (c) of subsection (2) of section 638 61.13, Florida Statutes, is amended to read 639 61.13âSupport of children; parenting and time-sharing; 640 powers of court.â 641 (2) 642 (c)âThe court shall determine all matters relating to 643 parenting and time-sharing of each minor child of the parties in 644 accordance with the best interests of the child and in 645 accordance with the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and 646 Enforcement Act, except that modification of a parenting plan 647 and time-sharing schedule requires a showing of a substantial 648 and material change of circumstances. 649 1.âIt is the public policy of this state that each minor 650 child has frequent and continuing contact with both parents 651 after the parents separate or the marriage of the parties is 652 dissolved and to encourage parents to share the rights and 653 responsibilities, and joys, of childrearing. Unless otherwise 654 provided in this section or agreed to by the parties, there is a 655 rebuttable presumption that equal time-sharing of a minor child 656 is in the best interests of the minor child. To rebut this 657 presumption, a party must prove by a preponderance of the 658 evidence that equal time-sharing is not in the best interests of 659 the minor child. Except when a time-sharing schedule is agreed 660 to by the parties and approved by the court, the court must 661 evaluate all of the factors set forth in subsection (3) and make 662 specific written findings of fact when creating or modifying a 663 time-sharing schedule. 664 2.âThe court shall order that the parental responsibility 665 for a minor child be shared by both parents unless the court 666 finds that shared parental responsibility would be detrimental 667 to the child. In determining detriment to the child, the court 668 shall consider: 669 a.âEvidence of domestic violence, as defined in s. 741.28; 670 b.âWhether either parent has or has had reasonable cause to 671 believe that he or she or his or her minor child or children are 672 or have been in imminent danger of becoming victims of an act of 673 domestic violence as defined in s. 741.28 or sexual violence as 674 defined in s. 784.046(1) s. 784.046(1)(c) by the other parent 675 against the parent or against the child or children whom the 676 parents share in common regardless of whether a cause of action 677 has been brought or is currently pending in the court; 678 c.âWhether either parent has or has had reasonable cause to 679 believe that his or her minor child or children are or have been 680 in imminent danger of becoming victims of an act of abuse, 681 abandonment, or neglect, as those terms are defined in s. 39.01, 682 by the other parent against the child or children whom the 683 parents share in common regardless of whether a cause of action 684 has been brought or is currently pending in the court; and 685 d.âAny other relevant factors. 686 3.âThe following evidence creates a rebuttable presumption 687 that shared parental responsibility is detrimental to the child: 688 a.âA parent has been convicted of a misdemeanor of the 689 first degree or higher involving domestic violence, as defined 690 in s. 741.28 and chapter 775; 691 b.âA parent meets the criteria of s. 39.806(1)(d); or 692 c.âA parent has been convicted of or had adjudication 693 withheld for an offense enumerated in s. 943.0435(1)(h)1.a., and 694 at the time of the offense: 695 (I)âThe parent was 18 years of age or older. 696 (II)âThe victim was under 18 years of age or the parent 697 believed the victim to be under 18 years of age. 698 699 If the presumption is not rebutted after the convicted parent is 700 advised by the court that the presumption exists, shared 701 parental responsibility, including time-sharing with the child, 702 and decisions made regarding the child, may not be granted to 703 the convicted parent. However, the convicted parent is not 704 relieved of any obligation to provide financial support. If the 705 court determines that shared parental responsibility would be 706 detrimental to the child, it may order sole parental 707 responsibility and make such arrangements for time-sharing as 708 specified in the parenting plan as will best protect the child 709 or abused spouse from further harm. Whether or not there is a 710 conviction of any offense of domestic violence or child abuse or 711 the existence of an injunction for protection against domestic 712 violence, the court shall consider evidence of domestic violence 713 or child abuse as evidence of detriment to the child. 714 4.âIn ordering shared parental responsibility, the court 715 may consider the expressed desires of the parents and may grant 716 to one party the ultimate responsibility over specific aspects 717 of the childâs welfare or may divide those responsibilities 718 between the parties based on the best interests of the child. 719 Areas of responsibility may include education, health care, and 720 any other responsibilities that the court finds unique to a 721 particular family. 722 5.âThe court shall order sole parental responsibility for a 723 minor child to one parent, with or without time-sharing with the 724 other parent if it is in the best interests of the minor child. 725 6.âThere is a rebuttable presumption against granting time 726 sharing with a minor child if a parent has been convicted of or 727 had adjudication withheld for an offense enumerated in s. 728 943.0435(1)(h)1.a., and at the time of the offense: 729 a.âThe parent was 18 years of age or older. 730 b.âThe victim was under 18 years of age or the parent 731 believed the victim to be under 18 years of age. 732 733 A parent may rebut the presumption upon a specific finding in 734 writing by the court that the parent poses no significant risk 735 of harm to the child and that time-sharing is in the best 736 interests of the minor child. If the presumption is rebutted, 737 the court must consider all time-sharing factors in subsection 738 (3) when developing a time-sharing schedule. 739 7.âAccess to records and information pertaining to a minor 740 child, including, but not limited to, medical, dental, and 741 school records, may not be denied to either parent. Full rights 742 under this subparagraph apply to either parent unless a court 743 order specifically revokes these rights, including any 744 restrictions on these rights as provided in a domestic violence 745 injunction. A parent having rights under this subparagraph has 746 the same rights upon request as to form, substance, and manner 747 of access as are available to the other parent of a child, 748 including, without limitation, the right to in-person 749 communication with medical, dental, and education providers. 750 Section 4.âParagraph (a) of subsection (3) of section 751 61.1825, Florida Statutes, is amended to read: 752 61.1825âState Case Registry.â 753 (3)(a)âFor the purpose of this section, a family violence 754 indicator must be placed on a record when: 755 1.âA party executes a sworn statement requesting that a 756 family violence indicator be placed on that partyâs record which 757 states that the party has reason to believe that release of 758 information to the Federal Case Registry may result in physical 759 or emotional harm to the party or the child;
