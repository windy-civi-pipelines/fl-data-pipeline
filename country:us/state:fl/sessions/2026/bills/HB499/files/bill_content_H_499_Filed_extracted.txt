226 1. That placement in shelter care is necessary based on
227 the criteria in subsection (1), subsection (2), or subsection
228 (3) subsections (1) and (2).
229 2. That placement in shelter care is in the best interest
230 of the child.
231 3. That continuation of the child in the home is contrary
232 to the welfare of the child because the home situation presents
233 a substantial and immediate danger to the child's physical,
234 mental, or emotional health or safety which cannot be mitigated
235 by the provision of preventive services.
236 4. That based upon the allegations of the petition for
237 placement in shelter care, there is probable cause to believe
238 that the child is dependent or that the court needs additional

241 appropriately determine the risk to the child.
242 5. That the department has made reasonable efforts to
243 prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from the

252 immediate danger to the child's physical, mental, or emotional
253 health or safety which cannot be mitigated by the provision of
254 preventive services;
255 c. The child cannot safely remain at home, either because
256 there are no preventive services that can ensure the health and
257 safety of the child or because, even with appropriate and
258 available services being provided, the health and safety of the
259 child cannot be ensured; or
260 d. The parent or legal custodian is alleged to have
261 committed any of the acts listed as grounds for expedited
262 termination of parental rights in s. 39.806(1)(f)-(i).
263 6. That the department has made reasonable efforts to
264 place the child in order of priority as provided in s. 39.4021
265 unless such priority placement is not a placement option or in
266 the best interest of the child based on the criteria and factors
267 set out in s. 39.01375.
268 7. That the department has made reasonable efforts to keep
269 siblings together if they are removed and placed in out-of-home
270 care unless such placement is not in the best interest of each
271 child. It is preferred that siblings be kept together in a
272 foster home, if available. Other reasonable efforts shall
273 include short-term placement in a group home with the ability to
274 accommodate sibling groups if such a placement is available. The
275 department shall report to the court its efforts to place

276 siblings together unless the court finds that such placement is
277 not in the best interest of a child or his or her sibling.
278 8. That the court notified the parents, relatives that are
279 providing out-of-home care for the child, or legal custodians of
280 the time, date, and location of the next dependency hearing and
281 of the importance of the active participation of the parents,
282 relatives that are providing out-of-home care for the child, or
283 legal custodians in all proceedings and hearings.
284 9. That the court notified the parents or legal custodians
285 of their right to counsel to represent them at the shelter
286 hearing and at each subsequent hearing or proceeding, and the
287 right of the parents to appointed counsel, pursuant to the
288 procedures set forth in s. 39.013.
289 10. That the court notified relatives who are providing
290 out-of-home care for a child as a result of the shelter petition
291 being granted that they have the right to attend all subsequent
292 hearings, to submit reports to the court, and to speak to the
293 court regarding the child, if they so desire.
294 11. That the department has placement and care
295 responsibility for any child who is not placed in the care of a

319 entitled to full access to the information gathered by the

226 1. That placement in shelter care is necessary based on
227 the criteria in subsection (1), subsection (2), or subsection
228 (3) subsections (1) and (2).
229 2. That placement in shelter care is in the best interest
230 of the child.
231 3. That continuation of the child in the home is contrary
232 to the welfare of the child because the home situation presents
233 a substantial and immediate danger to the child's physical,
234 mental, or emotional health or safety which cannot be mitigated
235 by the provision of preventive services.
236 4. That based upon the allegations of the petition for
237 placement in shelter care, there is probable cause to believe
238 that the child is dependent or that the court needs additional

240 review documents pertaining to the family in order to
241 appropriately determine the risk to the child.
242 5. That the department has made reasonable efforts to
243 prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from the
244 home. A finding of reasonable effort by the department to
245 prevent or eliminate the need for removal may be made and the
246 department is deemed to have made reasonable efforts to prevent

251 indicates that the home situation presents a substantial and
252 immediate danger to the child's physical, mental, or emotional
253 health or safety which cannot be mitigated by the provision of
254 preventive services;
255 c. The child cannot safely remain at home, either because
256 there are no preventive services that can ensure the health and
257 safety of the child or because, even with appropriate and
258 available services being provided, the health and safety of the
259 child cannot be ensured; or
260 d. The parent or legal custodian is alleged to have
261 committed any of the acts listed as grounds for expedited
262 termination of parental rights in s. 39.806(1)(f)-(i).
263 6. That the department has made reasonable efforts to
264 place the child in order of priority as provided in s. 39.4021
265 unless such priority placement is not a placement option or in
266 the best interest of the child based on the criteria and factors
267 set out in s. 39.01375.
268 7. That the department has made reasonable efforts to keep
269 siblings together if they are removed and placed in out-of-home
270 care unless such placement is not in the best interest of each
271 child. It is preferred that siblings be kept together in a
272 foster home, if available. Other reasonable efforts shall
273 include short-term placement in a group home with the ability to
274 accommodate sibling groups if such a placement is available. The
275 department shall report to the court its efforts to place

276 siblings together unless the court finds that such placement is
277 not in the best interest of a child or his or her sibling.
278 8. That the court notified the parents, relatives that are
279 providing out-of-home care for the child, or legal custodians of
280 the time, date, and location of the next dependency hearing and
281 of the importance of the active participation of the parents,
282 relatives that are providing out-of-home care for the child, or
283 legal custodians in all proceedings and hearings.
284 9. That the court notified the parents or legal custodians
285 of their right to counsel to represent them at the shelter
286 hearing and at each subsequent hearing or proceeding, and the
287 right of the parents to appointed counsel, pursuant to the
288 procedures set forth in s. 39.013.
289 10. That the court notified relatives who are providing
290 out-of-home care for a child as a result of the shelter petition
291 being granted that they have the right to attend all subsequent
292 hearings, to submit reports to the court, and to speak to the
293 court regarding the child, if they so desire.
294 11. That the department has placement and care
295 responsibility for any child who is not placed in the care of a
296 parent at the conclusion of the shelter hearing.

312 investigations are more feasible. When conducting investigations

318 the report. Each agency conducting a joint investigation is
319 entitled to full access to the information gathered by the
