   15          
   16  Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Florida:
   17  
   18         Section 1.â<u class="Insert">This act may be cited as the âPromoting Work,</u>
   19  <u class="Insert">Deterring Fraud Act of 2026.â</u>
   20         Section 2.âSubsection (2) of section 443.101, Florida
   21  Statutes, is amended to read:
   22         443.101âDisqualification for benefits.âAn individual shall
   23  be disqualified for benefits:
   24         (2)âIf the Department of Commerce finds that the individual
   25  has failed without good cause to apply for available suitable
   26  work, <u class="Insert">including contacting the required number of prospective</u>
   27  <u class="Insert">employers per week for any week of unemployment claimed in the</u>
   28  <u class="Insert">benefit year in accordance with s. 443.091, to appear on three</u>
   29  <u class="Insert">or more occasions for a scheduled job interview without</u>
   30  <u class="Insert">notifying the prospective employer of the need to cancel or</u>
   31  <u class="Insert">reschedule the interview, to</u> accept suitable work when offered
   32  to him or her, <u class="Insert">to</u> <s class="Remove">or</s> return to the individualâs customary self
   33  employment when directed by the department<u class="Insert">, or to return to</u>
   34  <u class="Insert">employment when recalled to work by the individualâs employer</u>
   35  <u class="Insert">after a temporary layoff</u>, the disqualification continues for the
   36  <u class="Insert">next</u> full period of unemployment <s class="Remove">next ensuing</s> after he or she
   37  failed without good cause to apply for available suitable work,
   38  accept suitable work, or return to his or her customary
   39  <u class="Insert">employment or</u> self-employment, and until the individual has
   40  earned income of at least 17 times his or her weekly benefit
   41  amount. The department shall by rule adopt criteria <u class="Insert">to implement</u>
   42  <u class="Insert">this subsection, including</u> for determining the âsuitability of
   43  work,â <u class="Insert">or âsuitable work,â</u> as used in this section. In
   44  developing these rules, the department shall consider the
   45  duration of a claimantâs unemployment in determining the
   46  suitability of work and the suitability of proposed rates of
   47  compensation for available work. Further, after an individual
   48  has received 25 weeks of benefits in a single year, suitable
   49  work is a job that pays the minimum wage and is 120 percent or
   50  more of the weekly benefit amount the individual is drawing.
   51         (a)âIn determining whether <s class="Remove">or not any</s> work is suitable for
   52  an individual, the department shall consider the degree of risk
   53  to the individualâs health, safety, and morals; the individualâs
   54  physical fitness, prior training, experience, prior earnings,
   55  length of unemployment, and prospects for securing local work in
   56  his or her customary occupation; and the distance of the
   57  available work from his or her residence.
   58         (b)âNotwithstanding <s class="Remove">any other provisions of</s> this chapter,
   59  work is not deemed suitable and benefits may not be denied to
   60  any otherwise eligible individual for refusing to accept new
   61  work under any of the following conditions:
   62         1.âThe position offered is vacant due directly to a strike,
   63  lockout, or other labor dispute.
   64         2.âThe wages, hours, or other conditions of the work
   65  offered are substantially less favorable to the individual than
   66  those prevailing for similar work in the locality.
   67         3.âAs a condition of being employed, the individual is
   68  required to join a company union or to resign from or refrain
   69  from joining any bona fide labor organization.
   70         (c)âIf the department finds that an individual was rejected
   71  for offered employment as the direct result of a positive,
   72  confirmed drug test required as a condition of employment, the
   73  individual is disqualified for refusing to accept an offer of
   74  suitable work.
   75         Section 3.âSection 443.1112, Florida Statutes, is created
   76  to read:
