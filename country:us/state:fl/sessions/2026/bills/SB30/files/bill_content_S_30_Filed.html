    1                        A bill to be entitled                      
    2         An act relating to rate filings for property insurers;
    3         amending s. 627.0613, F.S.; revising the powers of the
    4         consumer advocate; specifying that failure to obey
    5         certain court orders may be punished as contempt;
    6         authorizing a circuit court to order a person to pay
    7         certain expenses; amending s. 627.062, F.S.;
    8         prohibiting the Office of Insurance Regulation from
    9         approving certain rate filings; authorizing the
   10         consumer advocate to request a specified
   11         administrative hearing and an expedited appellate
   12         review; providing an effective date.
   13          
   14  Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Florida:
   15  
   16         Section 1.âSubsections (5) and (6) are added to section
   17  627.0613, Florida Statutes, to read:
   18         627.0613âConsumer advocate.âThe Chief Financial Officer
   19  must appoint a consumer advocate who must represent the general
   20  public of the state before the department and the office. The
   21  consumer advocate must report directly to the Chief Financial
   22  Officer, but is not otherwise under the authority of the
   23  department or of any employee of the department. The consumer
   24  advocate has such powers as are necessary to carry out the
   25  duties of the office of consumer advocate, including, but not
   26  limited to, the powers to:
   27         <u class="Insert">(5)âRequest an administrative hearing pursuant to s. 120.57</u>
   28  <u class="Insert">to challenge a notice of intent to approve or a notice of intent</u>
   29  <u class="Insert">to disapprove a rate filing.</u>
   30         <u class="Insert">(6)</u><u class="Insert">â</u><u class="Insert">Administer oaths or affirmations to compel the</u>
   31  <u class="Insert">attendance and testimony of witnesses</u><u class="Insert">,</u><u class="Insert"> or to issue subpoenas for</u>
   32  <u class="Insert">and compel the production of books, papers, records, documents,</u>
   33  <u class="Insert">and other evidence</u><u class="Insert">,</u><u class="Insert"> pertaining to any investigation or hearing</u>
   34  <u class="Insert">convened under this section.</u>
   35         <u class="Insert">(a)</u><u class="Insert">â</u><u class="Insert">In conducting an investigation, the consumer advocate</u>
   36  <u class="Insert">and its investigators </u><u class="Insert">must</u><u class="Insert"> have access at all reasonable times</u>
   37  <u class="Insert">to premises, records, documents, and other evidence or possible</u>
   38  <u class="Insert">sources of evidence and may examine, record, and copy such</u>
   39  <u class="Insert">materials and take and record the testimony or statements of</u>
   40  <u class="Insert">such persons as </u><u class="Insert">deemed</u><u class="Insert"> reasonably necessary for the furtherance</u>
   41  <u class="Insert">of the investigation.</u>
   42         <u class="Insert">(b)</u><u class="Insert">â</u><u class="Insert">In the case of a refusal to obey a subpoena issued to</u>
   43  <u class="Insert">any person, the consumer advocate may make application to any</u>
   44  <u class="Insert">circuit court of this state, which </u><u class="Insert">court </u><u class="Insert">shall have jurisdiction</u>
   45  <u class="Insert">to order the witness to appear before the consumer advocate to</u>
   46  <u class="Insert">give testimony and to produce evidence concerning the matter in</u>
   47  <u class="Insert">question. Failure to obey the courtâs order may be punished by</u>
   48  <u class="Insert">the court as contempt. If the court enters an order holding a</u>
   49  <u class="Insert">person in contempt or compelling the person to comply with the</u>
   50  <u class="Insert">subpoena, the court </u><u class="Insert">may</u><u class="Insert"> order the person to pay the consumer</u>
   51  <u class="Insert">advocate reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorney</u>
   52  <u class="Insert">fees, accrued by the consumer advocate in obtaining the order</u>
   53  <u class="Insert">from the court.</u>
   54         Section 2.âParagraph (a) of subsection (2) and subsection
   55  (6) of section 627.062, Florida Statutes, are amended to read:
   56         627.062âRate standards.â
   57         (2)âAs to all such classes of insurance:
   58         (a)âInsurers or rating organizations shall establish and
   59  use rates, rating schedules, or rating manuals that allow the
   60  insurer a reasonable rate of return on the classes of insurance
   61  written in this state. A copy of rates, rating schedules, rating
   62  manuals, premium credits or discount schedules, and surcharge
   63  schedules, and changes thereto, must be filed with the office
   64  under one of the following procedures:
   65         1.âIf the filing is made at least 90 days before the
   66  proposed effective date and is not implemented during the
   67  officeâs review of the filing and any proceeding and judicial
   68  review, such filing is considered a âfile and useâ filing. In
   69  such case, the office shall finalize its review by issuance of a
   70  notice of intent to approve or a notice of intent to disapprove
   71  within 90 days after receipt of the filing. If the 90-day period
   72  ends on a weekend or a holiday under s. 110.117(1)(a)-(i), it
   73  must be extended until the conclusion of the next business day.
   74  The notice of intent to approve and the notice of intent to
   75  disapprove constitute agency action for purposes of the
   76  Administrative Procedure Act. Requests for supporting
   77  information, requests for mathematical or mechanical
   78  corrections, or notification to the insurer by the office of its
   79  preliminary findings does not toll the 90-day period during any
   80  such proceedings and subsequent judicial review. The rate shall
   81  be deemed approved if the office does not issue a notice of
   82  intent to approve or a notice of intent to disapprove within 90
   83  days after receipt of the filing.
   84         2.âIf the filing is not made in accordance with
   85  subparagraph 1., such filing must be made as soon as
   86  practicable, but within 30 days after the effective date, and is
   87  considered a âuse and fileâ filing. An insurer making a âuse and
   88  fileâ filing is potentially subject to an order by the office to
   89  return to policyholders those portions of rates found to be
   90  excessive, as provided in paragraph (h).
   91         3.âFor all property insurance filings made or submitted
   92  after January 25, 2007, but before May 1, 2012, an insurer
   93  seeking a rate that is greater than the rate most recently
   94  approved by the office shall make a âfile and useâ filing. For
   95  purposes of this subparagraph, motor vehicle collision and
   96  comprehensive coverages are not considered property coverages.
   97         <u class="Insert">4.</u><u class="Insert">â</u><u class="Insert">The office may not approve any property insurance filing</u>
   98  <u class="Insert">made or submitted on or after July 1, 2026, if the proposed rate</u>
   99  <u class="Insert">is more than 10 percent above the highest rate approved by the</u>
  100  <u class="Insert">office within the past 12 months. If multiple rate filings occur</u>
  101  <u class="Insert">within a 12-month period, the office may not approve a total</u>
  102  <u class="Insert">cumulative increase that is more than 15 percent above the</u>
  103  <u class="Insert">highest approved rate within the past 12 months.</u>
  104  
  105  The provisions of this subsection do not apply to workersâ
  106  compensation, employerâs liability insurance, and motor vehicle
  107  insurance.
  108         (6)(a)âIf an insurer <u class="Insert">or the consumer advocate under s.</u>
  109  <u class="Insert">627.0613</u> requests an administrative hearing pursuant to s.
  110  120.57 related to a rate filing under this section, the director
  111  of the Division of Administrative Hearings <u class="Insert">must</u> <s class="Remove">shall</s> expedite
  112  the hearing and assign an administrative law judge who shall
  113  commence the hearing within 30 days after the receipt of the
  114  formal request and enter a recommended order within 30 days
  115  after the hearing or within 30 days after receipt of the hearing
  116  transcript by the administrative law judge, whichever is later.
  117  Each party shall have 10 days in which to submit written
  118  exceptions to the recommended order. The office shall enter a
  119  final order within 30 days after the entry of the recommended
  120  order. The provisions of this paragraph may be waived upon
  121  stipulation of all parties.
  122         (b)âUpon entry of a final order, the insurer <u class="Insert">or the</u>
  123  <u class="Insert">consumer advocate under s. 627.0613</u> may request an expedited
  124  appellate review pursuant to the Florida Rules of Appellate
  125  Procedure. It is the intent of the Legislature that the First
  126  District Court of Appeal grant an insurerâs <u class="Insert">or a consumer</u>
  127  <u class="Insert">advocateâs</u> request for an expedited appellate review.
  128         Section 3.âThis act shall take effect July 1, 2026.
