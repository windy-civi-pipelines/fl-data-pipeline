 3039         1.âThe project must be deemed a critical need and must be

 3044  Committee or a project review subcommittee convened by the chair
 3045  of the committee to include two representatives of the
 3046  department and two staff members from school districts not

 3048  request a preapplication review at any time; however, if the
 3049  district school board seeks inclusion in the departmentâs next
 3050  annual capital outlay legislative budget request, the
 3051  preapplication review request must be made before February 1.
 3052  Within 90 days after receiving the preapplication review
 3053  request, the committee or subcommittee must meet in the school
 3054  district to review the project proposal and existing facilities.
 3055  To determine whether the proposed project is a critical need,

 3058  determined by the Florida Inventory of School Houses; the

 3060  and projected capital outlay full-time equivalent student
 3061  enrollment as determined by the demographic, revenue, and

 3064  all existing district property and facilities; grade level

 3067         2.âThe construction project must be recommended in the most
 3068  recent survey or survey amendment cooperatively prepared by the
 3069  district and the department, and approved by the department
 3070  under the rules of the State Board of Education. If a district

 3072  amendment, the consultant may not be employed by or receive
 3073  compensation from a third party that designs or constructs a
 3074  project recommended by the survey.

 3079  for the construction project in compliance with s. 1013.36 and
 3080  the rules of the State Board of Education.
 3081         5.âThe district shall have developed a district school
 3082  board adopted list of facilities that do not exceed the norm for
 3083  net square feet occupancy requirements under the State

 3085  programmatic combinations for multiple use of space to obtain
 3086  maximum daily use of all spaces within the facility under
 3087  consideration.
 3088         6.âUpon construction, the total cost per student station,
 3089  including change orders, must not exceed the cost per student
 3090  station as provided in subsection (6) unless approved by the
 3091  Special Facility Construction Committee. At the discretion of
 3092  the committee, costs that exceed the cost per student station
 3093  for special facilities may include legal and administrative
 3094  fees, the cost of site improvements or related offsite
 3095  improvements, the cost of complying with public shelter and
