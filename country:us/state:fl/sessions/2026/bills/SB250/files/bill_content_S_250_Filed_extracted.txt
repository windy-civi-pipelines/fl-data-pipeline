However, the Legislature further finds that a subset of 1176 rural communities has decreased in population over the past 1177 decade, contributing to a decline in local business activity and 1178 economic development. The Legislature therefore determines that 1179 state assistance must evolve to support these communities in 1180 achieving the foundation necessary for economic viability. The 1181 intent of the Renaissance Grants Program is to reverse economic 1182 deterioration in such rural communities by retaining and 1183 attracting residents by giving them a reason to stay, which will 1184 stimulate natural economic growth, business opportunities, and 1185 improved quality of life. 1186 (2)âThe Office of Rural Prosperity within the department 1187 shall administer the Renaissance Grants Program to provide block 1188 grants to eligible counties.

This may include 1003 establishing a circuit in specific rural locations to ensure the 1004 consultantsâ availability on a regular basis.

However, the Legislature further finds that a subset of 1176 rural communities has decreased in population over the past 1177 decade, contributing to a decline in local business activity and 1178 economic development. The Legislature therefore determines that 1179 state assistance must evolve to support these communities in 1180 achieving the foundation necessary for economic viability. The 1181 intent of the Renaissance Grants Program is to reverse economic 1182 deterioration in such rural communities by retaining and 1183 attracting residents by giving them a reason to stay, which will 1184 stimulate natural economic growth, business opportunities, and 1185 improved quality of life. 1186 (2)âThe Office of Rural Prosperity within the department 1187 shall administer the Renaissance Grants Program to provide block 1188 grants to eligible counties.
