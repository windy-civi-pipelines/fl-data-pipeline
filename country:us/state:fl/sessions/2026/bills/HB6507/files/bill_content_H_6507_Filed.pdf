51 birth, the department determined that L.E. was in "present
52 danger" if left in the care of her parents and that immediate
53 action was necessary to protect L.E. from further abuse or
54 neglect, and
55 WHEREAS, the department contracted with a child welfare
56 agency and, instead of removing L.E. from her parents' care

77 investigation, and
78 WHEREAS, on September 18, 2019, the subcontractor
79 transitioned its services from safety management to nonjudicial
80 in-home services, which inherently decreased monitoring of L.E.
81 by child welfare professionals, and
82 WHEREAS, on September 24, 2019, the department closed its
83 investigation, despite having no evidence of change or progress
84 with L.E.'s parents, and

86 provided services to the parents, the department expressly
87 acknowledged in its own investigative summary that, at the time
88 of closing its case, "[t]he home environment continues to be
89 volatile and unstable on a normal basis. The fighting in the
90 home will stabilize for a period of time but will always return
91 to a chaotic and aggressive environment... [violent and
92 impulsive behaviors] are clearly evident and severe... there
93 [have] been no clear changes made to their behaviors and the
94 patterns continue... [and] all of the children [including L.E.]
95 are vulnerable," and
96 WHEREAS, the very next day, on September 25, 2019, L.E. was
97 brought to Rockledge Regional Hospital in distress and
