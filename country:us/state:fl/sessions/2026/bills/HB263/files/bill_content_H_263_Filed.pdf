502 Section 2. The Legislature finds that it is a public
503 necessity that the home addresses, telephone numbers, and dates
504 of birth of current county administrators, deputy county
505 administrators, assistant county administrators, city managers,
506 deputy city managers, and assistant city managers; the names,
507 home addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, photographs,
508 and places of employment of the spouses and children of current
509 county administrators, deputy county administrators, assistant
510 county administrators, city managers, deputy city managers, and
511 assistant city managers; and the names and locations of schools
512 and day care facilities attended by the children of current
513 county administrators, deputy county administrators, assistant
514 county administrators, city managers, deputy city managers, and
515 assistant city managers be made exempt from s. 119.07(1),
516 Florida Statutes, and s. 24(a), Article I of the State
517 Constitution. Such identifying and location information can be
518 used as a tool to perpetrate fraud against an individual or to
519 acquire sensitive personal, financial, medical, or familial
520 information, the release of which could cause great financial or
521 professional harm to the individual. In the course of performing
522 their managerial functions, current county administrators,
523 deputy county administrators, assistant county administrators,
524 city managers, deputy city managers, and assistant city managers
525 may make decisions and determinations that upset members of the

527 current county administrators, deputy county administrators,
528 assistant county administrators, city managers, deputy city
529 managers, and assistant city managers and their spouses and
530 children targets for acts of revenge. If such identifying and
531 location information is released, the safety of current county
532 administrators, deputy county administrators, assistant county
533 administrators, city managers, deputy city managers, and
534 assistant city managers and their spouses and children could be
535 seriously jeopardized. For these reasons, the Legislature finds
536 that it is a public necessity that such information be made
537 exempt from public records requirements.
