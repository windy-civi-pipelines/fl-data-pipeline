    2         An act relating to public records; amending s.
    3         790.065, F.S.; providing an exemption from public
    4         records requirements for records containing certain
    5         information pertaining to a buyer or transferee who is
    6         not found to be prohibited from receipt or transfer of
    7         ammunition; providing for future legislative review

   12          
   13  Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Florida:
   14  
   15         Section 1.âParagraph (a) of subsection (4) of section
   16  790.065, Florida Statutes, as amended by SB 88, 2026 Regular
   17  Session, is amended to read:
   18         790.065âSale and delivery of firearms and ammunition.â
   19         (4)(a)âAny records containing any of the information set
   20  forth in subsection (1) pertaining to a buyer or transferee who
   21  is not found to be prohibited from receipt or transfer of a
   22  firearm <u class="Insert">or ammunition</u> by reason of Florida and federal law<u class="Insert">,</u>
   23  which records are created by the Department of Law Enforcement
   24  to conduct the criminal history record check<u class="Insert">, are</u> <s class="Remove">shall be</s>
   25  confidential and exempt from <s class="Remove">the provisions of</s> s. 119.07(1) <u class="Insert">and</u>
   26  <u class="Insert">s. 24(a), Art. I of the State Constitution</u> and may not be
   27  disclosed by the Department of Law Enforcement or any officer or
   28  employee thereof to any person or to another agency. The
   29  Department of Law Enforcement shall destroy any such records
   30  forthwith after it communicates the approval and nonapproval
   31  numbers to the licensee and, in any event, such records shall be
   32  destroyed within 48 hours after the day of the response to the
   33  licenseeâs request.
   34         Section 2.â<u class="Insert">The amendments to s. 790.065(4)(a), Florida</u>
   35  <u class="Insert">Statutes, made by this act are subject to the Open Government</u>
   36  <u class="Insert">Sunset Review Act in accordance with s. 119.15, Florida</u>
   37  <u class="Insert">Statutes, and to s. 24(a), Article I of the State Constitution</u>
   38  <u class="Insert">and shall stand repealed on October 2, 2031, and the text of s.</u>
   39  <u class="Insert">790.065(4)(a), Florida Statutes, shall revert to that in</u>
   40  <u class="Insert">existence on September 30, 2026, except that any amendments to</u>
   41  <u class="Insert">such text enacted other than by this act shall be preserved and</u>
   42  <u class="Insert">continue to operate to the extent that such amendments are not</u>
   43  <u class="Insert">dependent upon the portions of text which expire pursuant to</u>
   44  <u class="Insert">this section, unless reviewed and saved from repeal through</u>
   45  <u class="Insert">reenactment by the Legislature.</u>
   46         Section 3.â<u class="Insert">The Legislature finds that it is a public</u>
   47  <u class="Insert">necessity that the information pertaining to an individual who</u>
   48  <u class="Insert">is a buyer or transferee who is not found to be prohibited from</u>
   49  <u class="Insert">receipt or transfer of ammunition under s. 790.065, Florida</u>
   50  <u class="Insert">Statutes, be made confidential and exempt from public records</u>
   51  <u class="Insert">requirements under s. 119.07(1), Florida Statutes, and s. 24(a),</u>
   52  <u class="Insert">Article I of the State Constitution. The knowledge that someone</u>
   53  <u class="Insert">has purchased ammunition can easily lead to the conclusion that</u>
   54  <u class="Insert">the applicant or licensee has, in fact, armed himself or</u>
   55  <u class="Insert">herself. The Legislature has found in prior legislative sessions</u>
   56  <u class="Insert">and has expressed in s. 790.335(1)(a)3., Florida Statutes, that</u>
   57  <u class="Insert">a list, record, or registry of legally owned firearms or law</u>
   58  <u class="Insert">abiding firearm owners is âan instrument that can be used as a</u>
   59  <u class="Insert">means to profile innocent citizens and to harass and abuse</u>
   60  <u class="Insert">American citizens based solely on their choice to own firearms</u>
   61  <u class="Insert">and exercise their Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms</u>
   62  <u class="Insert">as guaranteed under the United States Constitution.â Release of</u>
   63  <u class="Insert">personal identifying information of an individual who has</u>
   64  <u class="Insert">purchased ammunition could be used to harass an innocent person</u>
   65  <u class="Insert">based solely on that personâs exercised right to own a firearm.</u>
   66  <u class="Insert">Therefore, the Legislature finds that such information must be</u>
   67  <u class="Insert">held confidential and exempt from public records requirements.</u>
   68         Section 4.âThis act shall take effect on the same date that
   69  SB 88 or similar legislation takes effect, if such legislation
   70  is adopted in the same legislative session or an extension
   71  thereof and becomes a law.
