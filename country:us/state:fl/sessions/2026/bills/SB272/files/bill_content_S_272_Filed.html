  148  exemption under this section as a result of a clerical mistake
  149  or omission voluntarily discloses to the property appraiser that
  150  he or she was not entitled to the homestead exemption before the
  151  property appraiser notifies the owner of the mistake or
  152  omission, no back taxes shall be due.
  153         2.âIf the person who received the additional homestead
  154  exemption under this section as a result of a clerical mistake
  155  or omission does not voluntarily disclose to the property
  156  appraiser that he or she was not entitled to the homestead
  157  exemption before the property appraiser notifies the owner of
  158  the mistake or omission, back taxes shall be due for any year or
  159  years that the owner was not entitled to the limitation within
  160  the 5 years before the property appraiser notified the owner of
  161  the mistake or omission.

  163  owes back taxes under subparagraph 2. a notice of intent to
  164  record in the public records of the county a notice of tax lien
  165  against any property owned by that person in the county, and
  166  such property must be identified in the notice of tax lien. The
  167  property appraiser must include with such notice information
  168  explaining why the owner is not entitled to the limitation, the
  169  years for which unpaid taxes are due, and the manner in which
  170  unpaid taxes have been calculated. Before any such lien may be
  171  filed, the owner must be given 30 days within which to pay the
  172  taxes, penalties, and interest. Such a lien is subject to the
  173  procedures and provisions set forth in s. 196.161(3).
