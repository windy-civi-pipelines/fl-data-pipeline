The Legislature finds that smart 779 irrigation systems that use soil moisture sensors with remote 780 monitoring and adjustment capabilities, if properly installed 781 and monitored, provide more efficient irrigation and save 782 substantially more water than conventional time-controlled 783 irrigation systems. This is because smart irrigation systems 784 apply water to lawns and plants only as necessary to maintain 785 required soil moisture, thus minimizing the overwatering or 786 unnecessary watering that occurs with conventional irrigation 787 systems. However, in order for this technology to optimize the 788 efficient application of water it cannot be subject to day or 789 days-of-the-week watering restrictions. The Legislature, 790 therefore, recognizes that enacting a statewide process to 791 provide an exemption from local water restriction ordinances 792 will accelerate the adoption of this water saving technology. 793 Further, a uniform exemption process will streamline variance 794 procedures and minimize delay in implementing such technology. 795 The longer it takes to approve soil moisture sensor control 796 systems, the more potable water is wasted. A uniform variance 797 process will allow state residents to maintain their property 798 and protect water resources while enjoying their landscapes. 799 (b)âFor purposes of this subsection, the term: 800 1.ââMonitoring entityâ means a local government, community 801 development district created pursuant to chapter 190, a 802 homeownersâ association created pursuant to chapter 720, a 803 condominium association created pursuant to chapter 718, a 804 cooperative created pursuant to chapter 719, or a public or 805 private utility. 806 2.ââSoil moisture sensorâ means a soil-based device that 807 assesses the available plant soil moisture in order to minimize 808 the unnecessary use of water and optimize the effectiveness of 809 an irrigation system. 810 3.ââSoil moisture sensor control systemâ is the collective 811 term for an entire soil moisture sensor system that has remote 812 monitoring and adjustment capability. 813 (c)âA variance from day or days-of-the-week watering 814 schedules pursuant to s. 373.1866 restrictions, which includes 815 shall include the maximum soil set point for different soil 816 types within the monitoring entityâs jurisdiction, must shall be 817 granted by the applicable water management district for any 818 residential, commercial, or recreational user within a 819 monitoring entityâs jurisdiction having a soil moisture sensor 820 control system if the monitoring entity certifies that: 821 1.âEach soil moisture sensor control system installed 822 within its jurisdiction will have multiple soil sensors that 823 conform to different soil types and slopes in order to optimize 824 water use for each user, adjust irrigation schedules based on 825 soil moisture requirements, and be installed by a licensed 826 contractor in a manner that is consistent with the Field Guide 827 to Soil Moisture Sensor Use in Florida by the University of 828 Florida IFAS Extension Program for Resource Efficient 829 Communities. 830 2.âIt has the ability to monitor the status of each 831 individual userâs system and to remotely modify the system 832 settings for irrigation cycles and run times. 833 3.âIt will electronically post and update a list of active 834 users of soil moisture sensor control systems within its 835 jurisdiction on a monthly basis and provide Internet access to 836 such listing and the monitoring database to the water management 837 district and the local government. 838 4.âIt shall provide notice to a user of noncompliant 839 activity within 48 hours after such activity and, if the user 840 does not take corrective action within 48 hours after such 841 notice, it will remove the posted notice required in 842 subparagraph 5. and remove the user from the active users list 843 required by subparagraph 3. 844 5.âIt shall post a notice at each parcel that has installed 845 a compliant soil moisture sensor control system in plain view 846 from the nearest roadway stating: âIrrigating with Smart 847 Irrigation Controller,â with the address of the parcel, and 848 shall remove the notice if the user is no longer being monitored 849 by the monitoring entity. 850 (d)âUpon installation of a soil moisture sensor control 851 system, the licensed contractor shall certify to the monitoring 852 entity that subparagraphs (c)1. and (c)2. have been met. 853 1.âThe monitoring entity shall post the notice required by 854 subparagraph (c)5. on the userâs property and update the 855 Internet listing of users of active soil moisture sensor control 856 systems to include the new user. 857 2.âOn an annual basis a professional engineer licensed 858 under chapter 471 or a professional landscape architect licensed 859 under chapter 481 shall perform an annual maintenance review of 860 all soil moisture sensor control systems within the monitoring 861 entityâs jurisdiction and certify to the monitoring entity which 862 systems are properly operating and in compliance with paragraph 863 (c).

The Legislature finds that smart 779 irrigation systems that use soil moisture sensors with remote 780 monitoring and adjustment capabilities, if properly installed 781 and monitored, provide more efficient irrigation and save 782 substantially more water than conventional time-controlled 783 irrigation systems. This is because smart irrigation systems 784 apply water to lawns and plants only as necessary to maintain 785 required soil moisture, thus minimizing the overwatering or 786 unnecessary watering that occurs with conventional irrigation 787 systems. However, in order for this technology to optimize the 788 efficient application of water it cannot be subject to day or 789 days-of-the-week watering restrictions. The Legislature, 790 therefore, recognizes that enacting a statewide process to 791 provide an exemption from local water restriction ordinances 792 will accelerate the adoption of this water saving technology. 793 Further, a uniform exemption process will streamline variance 794 procedures and minimize delay in implementing such technology. 795 The longer it takes to approve soil moisture sensor control 796 systems, the more potable water is wasted. A uniform variance 797 process will allow state residents to maintain their property 798 and protect water resources while enjoying their landscapes. 799 (b)âFor purposes of this subsection, the term: 800 1.ââMonitoring entityâ means a local government, community 801 development district created pursuant to chapter 190, a 802 homeownersâ association created pursuant to chapter 720, a 803 condominium association created pursuant to chapter 718, a 804 cooperative created pursuant to chapter 719, or a public or 805 private utility. 806 2.ââSoil moisture sensorâ means a soil-based device that 807 assesses the available plant soil moisture in order to minimize 808 the unnecessary use of water and optimize the effectiveness of 809 an irrigation system. 810 3.ââSoil moisture sensor control systemâ is the collective 811 term for an entire soil moisture sensor system that has remote 812 monitoring and adjustment capability. 813 (c)âA variance from day or days-of-the-week watering 814 schedules pursuant to s. 373.1866 restrictions, which includes 815 shall include the maximum soil set point for different soil 816 types within the monitoring entityâs jurisdiction, must shall be 817 granted by the applicable water management district for any 818 residential, commercial, or recreational user within a 819 monitoring entityâs jurisdiction having a soil moisture sensor 820 control system if the monitoring entity certifies that: 821 1.âEach soil moisture sensor control system installed 822 within its jurisdiction will have multiple soil sensors that 823 conform to different soil types and slopes in order to optimize 824 water use for each user, adjust irrigation schedules based on 825 soil moisture requirements, and be installed by a licensed 826 contractor in a manner that is consistent with the Field Guide 827 to Soil Moisture Sensor Use in Florida by the University of 828 Florida IFAS Extension Program for Resource Efficient 829 Communities. 830 2.âIt has the ability to monitor the status of each 831 individual userâs system and to remotely modify the system 832 settings for irrigation cycles and run times. 833 3.âIt will electronically post and update a list of active 834 users of soil moisture sensor control systems within its 835 jurisdiction on a monthly basis and provide Internet access to 836 such listing and the monitoring database to the water management 837 district and the local government. 838 4.âIt shall provide notice to a user of noncompliant 839 activity within 48 hours after such activity and, if the user 840 does not take corrective action within 48 hours after such 841 notice, it will remove the posted notice required in 842 subparagraph 5. and remove the user from the active users list 843 required by subparagraph 3. 844 5.âIt shall post a notice at each parcel that has installed 845 a compliant soil moisture sensor control system in plain view 846 from the nearest roadway stating: âIrrigating with Smart 847 Irrigation Controller,â with the address of the parcel, and 848 shall remove the notice if the user is no longer being monitored 849 by the monitoring entity. 850 (d)âUpon installation of a soil moisture sensor control 851 system, the licensed contractor shall certify to the monitoring 852 entity that subparagraphs (c)1. and (c)2. have been met. 853 1.âThe monitoring entity shall post the notice required by 854 subparagraph (c)5. on the userâs property and update the 855 Internet listing of users of active soil moisture sensor control 856 systems to include the new user. 857 2.âOn an annual basis a professional engineer licensed 858 under chapter 471 or a professional landscape architect licensed 859 under chapter 481 shall perform an annual maintenance review of 860 all soil moisture sensor control systems within the monitoring 861 entityâs jurisdiction and certify to the monitoring entity which 862 systems are properly operating and in compliance with paragraph 863 (c).
