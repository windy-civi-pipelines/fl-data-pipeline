76 division under this chapter, or who is delinquent in the payment
77 of any monetary obligation due to the association, is not
78 eligible to be a candidate for board membership and may not be
79 listed on the ballot. A director or officer charged by
80 information or indictment with a felony theft or embezzlement
81 offense involving the association's funds or property is
82 suspended from office. The board shall fill the vacancy
83 according to general law until the end of the period of the
84 suspension or the end of the director's term of office,
85 whichever occurs first. However, if the charges are resolved
86 without a finding of guilt or without acceptance of a plea of
87 guilty or nolo contendere, the director or officer shall be
88 reinstated for any remainder of his or her term of office. A
89 member who has such criminal charges pending may not be
90 appointed or elected to a position as a director or officer. A

97 to the board. The validity of an action by the board is not
98 affected if it is later determined that a board member is

105 response to the inquirer, notify the inquirer that a legal
106 opinion has been requested, or notify the inquirer that advice
107 has been requested from the division. If the board requests
108 advice from the division, the board shall, within 10 days of its
109 receipt of the advice, provide in writing a substantive response
110 to the inquirer. If a legal opinion is requested, the board
111 shall, within 60 days after the receipt of the inquiry, provide
112 in writing a substantive response to the inquirer. The failure
113 to provide a substantive response to the inquirer as provided
114 herein precludes the board from recovering attorney's fees and
115 costs in any subsequent litigation, administrative proceeding,
116 or arbitration arising out of the inquiry. The association may,
117 through its board of administration, adopt reasonable rules and
118 regulations regarding the frequency and manner of responding to
119 the unit owners' inquiries, one of which may be that the
120 association is obligated to respond to only one written inquiry
121 per unit in any given 30-day period. In such case, any

123 subsequent 30-day period, or periods, as applicable.

162 appeal actions or hearings in its name on behalf of all members

184 requirements of those deed restrictions established prior to the
185 purchase of each parcel upon an affected parcel owner or owners.
