108 Section 2. Section 462.001, Florida Statutes, is created
109 to read:
110 462.001 Legislative findings; purpose.—The Legislature
111 finds that the interest of public health requires modernization
112 of regulation related to naturopathy in this state. Since 1927,
113 when Florida first regulated naturopathy, the profession and its
114 role within the healthcare industry have evolved including the
115 distinction that exists today between naturopathy and
116 naturopathic medicine, and this chapter reflects that evolution.
117 It is the intent of the Legislature to free naturopathy in this
118 state by removing the near total ban on the profession that has
119 been in place since 1959 by ensuring:
120 (1) Naturopathy is offered by naturopaths in this state.
121 (2) Naturopathic medicine is practiced in this state by
122 issuing licenses to naturopathic doctors who meet clear
123 standards of education and training, and who are held
124 accountable for safe practice.
125 Section 3. Section 462.002, Florida Statutes, is created

104 Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Florida:
105
106 Section 1. Chapter 462, Florida Statutes, entitled
107 "Naturopathy," is redesignated as "Naturopathic Medicine."
108 Section 2. Section 462.001, Florida Statutes, is created
109 to read:
110 462.001 Legislative findings; purpose.—The Legislature
111 finds that the interest of public health requires modernization
112 of regulation related to naturopathy in this state. Since 1927,
113 when Florida first regulated naturopathy, the profession and its
114 role within the healthcare industry have evolved including the
115 distinction that exists today between naturopathy and
116 naturopathic medicine, and this chapter reflects that evolution.
117 It is the intent of the Legislature to free naturopathy in this
118 state by removing the near total ban on the profession that has
119 been in place since 1959 by ensuring:
120 (1) Naturopathy is offered by naturopaths in this state.
121 (2) Naturopathic medicine is practiced in this state by
122 issuing licenses to naturopathic doctors who meet clear
123 standards of education and training, and who are held
124 accountable for safe practice.
125 Section 3. Section 462.002, Florida Statutes, is created
