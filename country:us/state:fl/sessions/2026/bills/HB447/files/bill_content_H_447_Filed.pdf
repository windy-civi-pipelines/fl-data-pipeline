127 (d)(4) A person or an entity receiving information
128 pursuant to this subsection section shall maintain that
129 information as confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1) and s.

136 repealed on October 2, 2031, unless reviewed and saved from

138 Section 3. (1) The Legislature finds that it is a public
139 necessity that court hearings under part I of chapter 394 and
140 part IV or part V of chapter 397, Florida Statutes, be made
141 confidential and closed to the public unless the court finds
142 good cause to open a hearing to the public or the respondent
143 consents to a hearing being open to the public. The mental
144 health or substance abuse disorders of a person are medical
145 conditions that should be protected from public disclosure. A
146 person's health and sensitive personal information regarding his
147 or her mental health or substance abuse disorders are intensely
148 private matters. Making hearings confidential and closed to the
149 public when such disorders, conditions, and personal information
150 may be communicated will protect such persons from the release

151 of sensitive personal information that could damage their and
152 their families' reputations. Allowing public hearings relating
153 to such information defeats the purpose of protections otherwise
154 provided. Further, the knowledge that such sensitive personal
155 information is subject to disclosure could have a chilling
156 effect on a person's willingness to seek out and comply with
157 mental health or substance abuse treatment services.
158 (2) The Legislature finds that it is a public necessity
159 that voluntary applications or petitions for involuntary
160 examination or treatment, court orders, and related records that
161 are filed with or by a court or relevant service provider under
162 part I of chapter 394 and part IV or part V of chapter 397,
163 Florida Statutes, and the personal identifying information of a
164 person with a potential mental, emotional, or behavioral
165 disorder or a substance abuse disorder which is published on a
166 court docket and maintained by the clerk of the court under part
167 I of chapter 394 and part IV or part V of chapter 397, Florida
168 Statutes, or with the relevant service provider be made
169 confidential and exempt from disclosure under s. 119.07(1),
170 Florida Statutes, and s. 24(a), Article I of the State
171 Constitution. The mental health or substance abuse disorders of
172 a person are medical conditions that should be protected from
173 public disclosure. A person's health and sensitive personal
174 information regarding his or her mental health or substance
175 abuse disorders are intensely private matters. Making such

176 applications, petitions, orders, records, and personal
177 identifying information confidential and exempt from disclosure
178 will protect such persons from the release of sensitive personal
179 information that could damage their and their families'
180 reputations. The publication of personal identifying information
181 on a physical or virtual docket, regardless of whether any other
182 record is published, defeats the purpose of protections
183 otherwise provided. Further, the knowledge that such sensitive
184 personal information is subject to disclosure could have a
185 chilling effect on a person's willingness to seek out and comply
186 with mental health or substance abuse treatment services.
