104
105 The general law must allow counties and municipalities to grant
106 these additional exemptions, within the limits prescribed in
107 this subsection, by ordinance adopted in the manner prescribed
108 by general law, and must provide for the periodic adjustment of
109 the income limitation prescribed in this subsection for changes
110 in the cost of living.
111 (e)(1) Each veteran who is age 65 or older who is
112 partially or totally permanently disabled shall receive a
113 discount from the amount of the ad valorem tax otherwise owed on
114 homestead property the veteran owns and resides in if the
115 disability was combat related and the veteran was honorably
116 discharged upon separation from military service. The discount
117 shall be in a percentage equal to the percentage of the
118 veteran's permanent, service-connected disability as determined
119 by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. To qualify
120 for the discount granted by this paragraph, an applicant must
121 submit to the county property appraiser, by March 1, an official

126 honorable discharge. If the property appraiser denies the
127 request for a discount, the appraiser must notify the applicant
128 in writing of the reasons for the denial, and the veteran may
129 reapply. The Legislature may, by general law, waive the annual
130 application requirement in subsequent years.
131 (2) If a veteran who receives the discount described in
132 paragraph (1) predeceases his or her spouse, and if, upon the
133 death of the veteran, the surviving spouse holds the legal or
134 beneficial title to the homestead property and permanently
135 resides thereon, the discount carries over to the surviving
136 spouse until he or she remarries or sells or otherwise disposes
137 of the homestead property. If the surviving spouse sells or
138 otherwise disposes of the property, a discount not to exceed the
139 dollar amount granted from the most recent ad valorem tax roll
140 may be transferred to the surviving spouse's new homestead
141 property, if used as his or her permanent residence and he or
142 she has not remarried.
143 (3) This subsection is self-executing and does not require
144 implementing legislation.
145 (f) By general law and subject to conditions and
146 limitations specified therein, the Legislature may provide ad
147 valorem tax relief equal to the total amount or a portion of the

153 the line of duty.
154 (3) A first responder who is totally and permanently
155 disabled as a result of an injury or injuries sustained in the
156 line of duty. Causal connection between a disability and service
157 in the line of duty shall not be presumed but must be determined
158 as provided by general law. For purposes of this paragraph, the
159 term "disability" does not include a chronic condition or
160 chronic disease, unless the injury sustained in the line of duty
161 was the sole cause of the chronic condition or chronic disease.
162
163 As used in this subsection and as further defined by general
164 law, the term "first responder" means a law enforcement officer,
165 a correctional officer, a firefighter, an emergency medical
166 technician, or a paramedic, and the term "in the line of duty"
