116 discharged upon separation from military service. The discount
117 shall be in a percentage equal to the percentage of the

132 paragraph (1) predeceases his or her spouse, and if, upon the
133 death of the veteran, the surviving spouse holds the legal or
134 beneficial title to the homestead property and permanently
135 resides thereon, the discount carries over to the surviving
136 spouse until he or she remarries or sells or otherwise disposes
137 of the homestead property. If the surviving spouse sells or
138 otherwise disposes of the property, a discount not to exceed the
139 dollar amount granted from the most recent ad valorem tax roll
140 may be transferred to the surviving spouse's new homestead
141 property, if used as his or her permanent residence and he or
142 she has not remarried.
143 (3) This subsection is self-executing and does not require
144 implementing legislation.

159 term "disability" does not include a chronic condition or

164 law, the term "first responder" means a law enforcement officer,
165 a correctional officer, a firefighter, an emergency medical
