457 6. The exemptions in this paragraph apply to information
458 held by an agency before, on, or after the effective date of the
459 exemption.
460 7. Information made exempt under this paragraph may be

476 protected party's request for release is pursuant to a
477 conveyance of his or her dwelling location, and must specify the
478 Official Records book and page, instrument number, or clerk's
479 file number for each document containing the information to be
480 released.
481 9. Upon the death of a protected party as verified by a
482 certified copy of a death certificate or court order, any party
483 can request the county recorder to release a protected
484 decedent's removed information unless there is a related request
485 on file with the county recorder for continued removal of the
486 decedent's information or unless such removal is otherwise
487 prohibited by statute or by court order. The written request to
488 release the removed information upon the death of a protected
489 party must attach the certified copy of a death certificate or
490 court order and must be notarized, must confirm the request for
491 release is due to the death of a protected party, and must
492 specify the Official Records book and page number, instrument
493 number, or clerk's file number for each document containing the
494 information to be released. A fee may not be charged for the
495 release of any document pursuant to such request.
496 Section 2. The Legislature finds that it is a public
497 necessity that the home addresses, telephone numbers, dates of
498 birth, and photographs of current and former medical examiners;
499 the names, home addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth,
500 and places of employment of the spouses and children of such

501 current and former medical examiners; and the names and
502 locations of schools and day care facilities attended by the
503 children of such current and former medical examiners be made
504 exempt from s. 119.07(1), Florida Statutes, and s. 24(a),
505 Article I of the State Constitution. The Legislature finds that
506 the release of such personal identifying and location
507 information poses potential security risks for and allows
508 unwarranted intrusion into the private lives of such current and
509 former medical examiners and their family members. Public
510 availability of such personal identifying and location
511 information may compromise the ability of such current and
512 former medical examiners to carry out their public duties and
513 may disrupt the operation of the medical examiners' offices. The
514 exemption of such personal identifying and location information
515 from public records requirements is necessary to protect the
516 personal privacy and safety of these public servants and their
517 families. The Legislature finds that the harm that may result
518 from the release of such personal identifying and location
519 information outweighs any public benefit that may be derived
520 from the disclosure of the information.
521 Section 3. This act shall take effect upon becoming a law.

476 protected party's request for release is pursuant to a
477 conveyance of his or her dwelling location, and must specify the
478 Official Records book and page, instrument number, or clerk's
479 file number for each document containing the information to be
480 released.
481 9. Upon the death of a protected party as verified by a
482 certified copy of a death certificate or court order, any party
483 can request the county recorder to release a protected
484 decedent's removed information unless there is a related request
485 on file with the county recorder for continued removal of the
486 decedent's information or unless such removal is otherwise
487 prohibited by statute or by court order. The written request to
488 release the removed information upon the death of a protected
489 party must attach the certified copy of a death certificate or
490 court order and must be notarized, must confirm the request for
491 release is due to the death of a protected party, and must
492 specify the Official Records book and page number, instrument
493 number, or clerk's file number for each document containing the
494 information to be released. A fee may not be charged for the

497 necessity that the home addresses, telephone numbers, dates of

501 current and former medical examiners; and the names and
502 locations of schools and day care facilities attended by the
503 children of such current and former medical examiners be made
504 exempt from s. 119.07(1), Florida Statutes, and s. 24(a),
505 Article I of the State Constitution. The Legislature finds that
506 the release of such personal identifying and location
507 information poses potential security risks for and allows
508 unwarranted intrusion into the private lives of such current and
509 former medical examiners and their family members. Public
510 availability of such personal identifying and location
511 information may compromise the ability of such current and
512 former medical examiners to carry out their public duties and
513 may disrupt the operation of the medical examiners' offices. The
514 exemption of such personal identifying and location information
515 from public records requirements is necessary to protect the
516 personal privacy and safety of these public servants and their
517 families. The Legislature finds that the harm that may result
518 from the release of such personal identifying and location
519 information outweighs any public benefit that may be derived
520 from the disclosure of the information.
521 Section 3. This act shall take effect upon becoming a law.
