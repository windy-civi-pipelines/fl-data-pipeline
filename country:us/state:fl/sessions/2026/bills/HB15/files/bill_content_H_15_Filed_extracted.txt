76 officer announces in a public meeting that, in connection with
77 the performance of the commission's duties, the commission must
78 discuss certain sensitive and confidential subject matters. In
79 the absence of a public meetings exemption, this state would be
80 prohibited from becoming a member state of the compact.

82 necessity that the recordings, minutes, and records generated
83 during a meeting held as provided in s. 491.022, Florida
84 Statutes, that is exempt from public meetings requirements be
85 made exempt from s. 119.07(1), Florida Statutes, and s. 24(a),

88 Legislature finds that the public records exemption is a public
89 necessity.
