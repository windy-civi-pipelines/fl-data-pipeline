   23         certain conditional limitations on damages by a
   24         specified percentage; providing an effective date.
   25          
   26  Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Florida:
   27  
   28         Section 1.âSection 409.993, Florida Statutes, is amended,
   29  to read:
   30         409.993âLead agencies and subcontractor liability.â
   31         (1)âFINDINGS.â
   32         (a)âThe Legislature finds that the state has traditionally
   33  provided foster care services to children who are the
   34  responsibility of the state. As such, foster children have not
   35  had the right to recover for injuries beyond the limitations
   36  specified in s. 768.28. The Legislature has determined that
   37  foster care and related services should be outsourced pursuant
   38  to this section and that the provision of such services is of
   39  paramount importance to the state. The purpose of such
   40  outsourcing is to increase the level of safety, security, and
   41  stability of children who are or become the responsibility of
   42  the state. One of the components necessary to secure a safe and
   43  stable environment for such children is the requirement that
   44  private providers maintain liability insurance. As such,
   45  insurance needs to be available and remain available to
   46  nongovernmental foster care and related services providers
   47  without the resources of such providers being significantly
   48  reduced by the cost of maintaining such insurance.
   49         (b)âThe Legislature further finds that, by requiring the
   50  following minimum levels of insurance, children in outsourced
   51  foster care and related services will gain increased protection
   52  and rights of recovery in the event of injury than currently
   53  provided in s. 768.28.
   54         <u class="Insert">(2)</u><u class="Insert">â</u><u class="Insert">DEFINITION.â</u><u class="Insert">As used in this section, the term âculpably</u>
   55  <u class="Insert">negligent mannerâ means reckless indifference or grossly</u>
   56  <u class="Insert">careless disregard of human life.</u>

   58         (a)âOther than an entity to which s. 768.28 applies, an
   59  eligible community-based care lead agency, or its employees or
   60  officers, except as otherwise provided in paragraph <u class="Insert">(e)</u> <s class="Remove">(b)</s>,
   61  shall, as a part of its contract, obtain a minimum of $1 million
   62  per occurrence with a policy period aggregate limit of $3
   63  million in general liability insurance coverage. The lead agency
   64  <u class="Insert">shall</u> <s class="Remove">must</s> also require that staff who transport client children
   65  and families in their personal automobiles in order to carry out
   66  their job responsibilities obtain minimum bodily injury
   67  liability insurance in the amount of $100,000 per person per any
   68  one automobile accident, and<u class="Insert">,</u> subject to such limits for each
   69  person, $300,000 for all damages resulting from any one
   70  automobile accident, on their personal automobiles. In lieu of
   71  personal motor vehicle insurance, the lead agencyâs casualty,
   72  liability, or motor vehicle insurance carrier may provide
   73  nonowned automobile liability coverage. This insurance provides
   74  liability insurance for an automobile that the lead agency uses
   75  in connection with the lead agencyâs business but does not own,
   76  lease, rent, or borrow. This coverage includes an automobile
   77  owned by an employee of the lead agency or a member of the
   78  employeeâs household but only while the automobile is used in
   79  connection with the lead agencyâs business. The nonowned
   80  automobile coverage for the lead agency applies as excess
   81  coverage over any other collectible insurance. The personal
   82  automobile policy for the employee of the lead agency <u class="Insert">must</u> <s class="Remove">shall</s>
   83  be primary insurance, and the nonowned automobile coverage of
   84  the lead agency acts as excess insurance to the primary
   85  insurance. The lead agency shall provide a minimum limit of $1
   86  million in nonowned automobile coverage. In a tort action
   87  brought against such a lead agency or employee, net economic
   88  damages <u class="Insert">are</u> <s class="Remove">shall be</s> limited to $2 million per liability claim
   89  and $200,000 per automobile claim, including, but not limited
   90  to, past and future medical expenses, wage loss, and loss of
   91  earning capacity, offset by any collateral source payment paid
   92  or payable. In any tort action brought against a lead agency,
   93  noneconomic damages <u class="Insert">are</u> <s class="Remove">shall be</s> limited to $400,000 per claim.
   94  A claims bill may be brought on behalf of a claimant pursuant to
   95  s. 768.28 for any amount exceeding the limits specified in this
   96  paragraph. Any offset of collateral source payments made as of
   97  the date of the settlement or judgment <u class="Insert">must</u> <s class="Remove">shall</s> be in
