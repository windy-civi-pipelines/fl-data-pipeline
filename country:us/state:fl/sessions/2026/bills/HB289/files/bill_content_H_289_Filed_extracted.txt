55 (1) When the death of a person is caused by the wrongful
56 act, negligence, default, or breach of contract or warranty of
57 any person, including those occurring on navigable waters, and
58 the event would have entitled the person injured to maintain an
59 action and recover damages if death had not ensued, the person
60 or watercraft that would have been liable in damages if death
61 had not ensued shall be liable for damages as specified in this
62 act notwithstanding the death of the person injured, although
63 death was caused under circumstances constituting a felony.

65 wrongful death action for the death of an unborn child may not
66 be brought against the mother of the unborn child or against a
67 health care provider, as defined in s. 766.202, for legal

69 assisted reproductive technologies, as defined in s. 742.13,

76 decedent shall be alleged. Damages may be awarded as follows:
77 (4) Each parent of a deceased minor child or an unborn
78 child may also recover for mental pain and suffering from the

82 the decedent's estate the following:
83 (a) Loss of earnings of the deceased from the date of
84 injury to the date of death, less lost support of survivors
85 excluding contributions in kind, with interest. Loss of the
86 prospective net accumulations of an estate, which might
87 reasonably have been expected but for the wrongful death,
88 reduced to present money value, may also be recovered:
89 1. If the decedent's survivors include a surviving spouse
90 or lineal descendants; or
91 2. If the decedent is not a minor child or an unborn child
