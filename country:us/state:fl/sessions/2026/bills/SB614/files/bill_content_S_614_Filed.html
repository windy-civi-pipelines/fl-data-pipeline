       <b>By </b>Senator Smith
       
       
       
       
       
       17-00431-26                                            2026614__
    1                        A bill to be entitled                      
    2         An act relating to parole for long-term prisoners;
    3         creating s. 947.161, F.S.; providing that certain
    4         offenders serving long-term prison sentences are
    5         parole eligible under certain circumstances; providing
    6         for retroactive application; specifying eligibility
    7         requirements; providing conditions of parole for such
    8         persons; providing for disposition of savings produced
    9         by such a program of parole; providing an effective
   10         date.
   11  
   12         WHEREAS, according to a report by the Florida Commission on
   13  Offender Review, â97.5 percent of parolees have successfully
   14  completed their parole supervision without revocation within the
   15  first 3 years of release,â signifying that parole is effective,
   16  and
   17         WHEREAS, long-term incarceration disproportionately impacts
   18  poor communities and communities of color, and
   19         WHEREAS, the costs of long-term incarceration are social,
   20  cultural, and economic and cause additional harm to society over
   21  and above the costs of the crime committed, and
   22         WHEREAS, the annual financial cost to incarcerate an
   23  individual in this state averages more than $28,000 per inmate
   24  per year, and
   25         WHEREAS, a 25-year study found that people who commit
   26  violent crimes may be less likely to commit another serious
   27  offense, and
   28         WHEREAS, of persons convicted of violent crimes, only 4
   29  percent who are released between ages 45 and 54 reoffend, and
   30  that number drops even further to 1 percent at age 55 and above,
   31  and among people previously convicted of murder, those rates
   32  fall to 1.5 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively, indicating
   33  that recidivism rates decline dramatically as people age, and
   34         WHEREAS, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 174 people were
   35  resentenced and released after having been sentenced to life
   36  without parole for homicides committed as children, and after
   37  they had been in the community for an average of 21 months, only
   38  2 persons (1.1 percent) had been reconvicted of any offense, and
   39         WHEREAS, in Maryland, 188 people serving life without
   40  parole, mostly for murder or rape, were released after serving
   41  30 or more years after a court ruled that jury instructions in
   42  their cases had been unconstitutional, and 6 years later, only 5
   43  persons (2.7 percent) had returned to prison either for
   44  violating parole or for committing a new crime, and
   45         WHEREAS, it is the intent of the Legislature to advance
   46  public safety through punishment, rehabilitation, and
   47  restorative practices, and when a sentence includes
   48  incarceration, these purposes are best served by terms that are
   49  proportionate to the seriousness of the offense and that provide
   50  uniformity in the sentences of offenders committing the same
   51  offense under similar circumstances, and
   52         WHEREAS, by providing a means to reevaluate a sentence
   53  after a certain period of time has passed, the Legislature
   54  intends to provide the tools to ensure these purposes are
   55  achieved if it is determined that the original sentence no
   56  longer advances the interests of justice and the offender is no
   57  longer a public safety risk, NOW, THEREFORE,
   58  
   59  Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Florida:
   60  
   61         Section 1.âSection 947.161, Florida Statutes, is created to
