426 custodian must maintain an exemption granted pursuant to sub-
427 subparagraph 2.z. until the qualifying conditions for the
428 exemption no longer apply to the person subject to the
429 exemption.
430 4.a. A county property appraiser, as defined in s.
431 192.001(3), or a county tax collector, as defined in s.
432 192.001(4), who receives a written and notarized request for

447 public records of the agency.
448 b. Any information restricted from public display,

451 5. An officer, an employee, a justice, a judge, or other
452 person specified in subparagraph 2. may submit a written request
453 for the release of his or her exempt information to the

459 6. The exemptions in this paragraph apply to information
460 held by an agency before, on, or after the effective date of the
461 exemption.
462 7. Information made exempt under this paragraph may be
463 disclosed pursuant to s. 28.2221 to a title insurer authorized

476 to the county recorder. The written request to release the
477 removed information must be notarized, must confirm that a
478 protected party's request for release is pursuant to a
479 conveyance of his or her dwelling location, and must specify the
480 Official Records book and page, instrument number, or clerk's
481 file number for each document containing the information to be
482 released.
483 9. Upon the death of a protected party as verified by a
484 certified copy of a death certificate or court order, any party
485 can request the county recorder to release a protected
486 decedent's removed information unless there is a related request
487 on file with the county recorder for continued removal of the
488 decedent's information or unless such removal is otherwise
489 prohibited by statute or by court order. The written request to
490 release the removed information upon the death of a protected
491 party must attach the certified copy of a death certificate or
492 court order and must be notarized, must confirm the request for
493 release is due to the death of a protected party, and must
494 specify the Official Records book and page number, instrument
495 number, or clerk's file number for each document containing the
496 information to be released. A fee may not be charged for the
497 release of any document pursuant to such request.
498 Section 2. The Legislature finds that it is a public
499 necessity that the home addresses, telephone numbers, dates of
500 birth, and photographs of current and former municipal clerks

501 and their staff, including elections filing officers, records
502 management liaison officers, and deputy or assistant municipal
503 clerks; the names, home addresses, telephone numbers, dates of
504 birth, and places of employment of the spouses and children of
505 current and former municipal clerks and their staff, including
506 elections filing officers, records management liaison officers,
507 and deputy or assistant municipal clerks; and the names and
508 locations of schools and day care facilities attended by the
509 children of current and former municipal clerks and their staff,
510 including elections filing officers, records management liaison
511 officers, and deputy or assistant municipal clerks, be made
512 exempt from s. 119.07(1), Florida Statutes, and s. 24(a),
513 Article I of the State Constitution. Municipal clerks and their
514 staff often handle sensitive information and perform critical
515 administrative functions. Many municipal staff members who
516 perform duties that include, or result in, investigations into
517 complaints regarding election fraud, legal enforcement of
518 special magistrate hearings related to neglect or abuse, or
519 other activities that could lead to a criminal prosecution are
520 exposed to threats and other acts of violence. Protecting their
521 personal information is essential to ensure their safety. The
522 Legislature further finds that the harm that may result from the
523 release of such personal identifying and location information
524 outweighs any public benefit that may be derived from the
525 disclosure of the information.
